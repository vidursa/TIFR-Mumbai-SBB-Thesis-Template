  abstract = {Functional regeneration after axonal injury requires transected axons to regrow and reestablish connection with their original target tissue. The spontaneous regenerative mechanism known as axonal fusion provides a highly efficient means of achieving targeted reconnection, as a regrowing axon is able to recognize and fuse with its own detached axon segment, thereby rapidly reestablishing the original axonal tract. Here, we use behavioral assays and fluorescent reporters to show that axonal fusion enables full recovery of function after axotomy of Caenorhabditis elegans mechanosensory neurons. Furthermore, we reveal that the phospholipid phosphatidylserine, which becomes exposed on the damaged axon to function as a ``save-me'' signal, defines the level of axonal fusion. We also show that successful axonal fusion correlates with the regrowth potential and branching of the proximal fragment and with the retraction length and degeneration of the separated segment. Finally, we identify discrete axonal domains that vary in their propensity to regrow through fusion and show that the level of axonal fusion can be genetically modulated. Taken together, our results reveal that axonal fusion restores full function to injured neurons, is dependent on exposure of phospholipid signals, and is achieved through the balance between regenerative potential and level of degeneration.},

Twenty-four hours postinjury, a numerous TUNEL-positive cells appeared both rostrally and caudally to the transection site. Those positive cells, however, gradually diminished in number by several days postinjury. In contrast, other TUNEL-positive cells were found scattered within the white matter remote from the lesion by the third day postinjury. These cells were typically embedded in or among vacuolated fibers, where they were identified in close proximity to the vacuolated space enclosed by myelin basic protein (MBP)-positive structures confirmed by TUNEL-MBP double staining. Because of their linear arrangement, these TUNEL-positive cells were considered interfascicular oligodendrocytes, a fact that was confirmed by the finding that some TUNEL-positive cells were also stained with CCI, a cell marker for oligodendrocyte. Electron microscopic studies revealed that the cells expressing apoptotic morphology were invariably encased in a space formed by myelin splitting. Although the biological significance of apoptotic interfascicular oligodendrocytes in the process of wallerian degeneration is yet to be determined, the finding of such profiles localized within degenerating myelin structures suggests that; oligodendrocytes may be "trapped" within rapidly swollen and disintegrating myelin lamellae, which isolates and perhaps predisposes them to death.}

  abstract = {Although neurons within the peripheral nervous system (PNS) have a remarkable ability to repair themselves after injury, neurons within the central nervous system (CNS) do not spontaneously regenerate. This problem has remained recalcitrant despite a century of research on the reaction of axons to injury. The balance between inhibitory cues present in the environment and the intrinsic growth capacity of the injured neuron determines the extent of axonal regeneration following injury. The cell body of an injured neuron must receive accurate and timely information about the site and extent of axonal damage in order to increase its intrinsic growth capacity and successfully regenerate. One of the mechanisms contributing to this process is retrograde transport of injury signals. For example, molecules activated at the injury site convey information to the cell body leading to the expression of regeneration-associated genes and increased growth capacity of the neuron. Here we discuss recent studies that have begun to dissect the injury-signaling pathways involved in stimulating the intrinsic growth capacity of injured neurons.},

Here, an immunoaffinity approach is utilized to enrich ubiquitylated isopeptides after trypsin digestion from five AD and five age-matched control postmortem brain tissues. Label-free MS-based proteomic analysis identified 4,291 unique ubiquitylation sites mapping to 1,682 unique proteins. Differential enrichment analysis showed that over 800 ubiquitylation sites were significantly altered between AD and control cases. Of these, approximately 80\% were increased in AD, including seven polyubiquitin linkages, which is consistent with proteolytic stress and high burden of ubiquitylated pathological aggregates in AD. The microtubule associated protein Tau, the core component of neurofibrillary tangles, had the highest number of increased sites of ubiquitylation per any protein in AD. Tau polyubiquitylation from AD brain homogenates was confirmed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation and by affinity capture using tandem ubiquitin binding entities (TUBEs). Co-modified peptides, with both ubiquitylation and phosphorylation sites, were also enriched in AD. Notably, many of the co-modified peptides mapped to Tau within KXGS motifs in the microtubule binding repeat suggesting that cross-talk between phosphorylation and ubiquitylation occurs on Tau in AD. Overall, these findings highlight the utility of MS to map ubiquitylated substrates in human brain and provides insight into mechanisms underlying pathological protein posttranslational modification in AD.},

  abstract = {Effective intracellular transport of proteins and organelles is critical in cells and is especially important for ensuring proper neuron functionality. In neurons, most proteins are synthesized in the cell body and must be transported through thin structures over long distances where normal diffusion is insufficient. Neurons transport subcellular cargo along axons and neurites through a stochastic interplay of active and passive transport. Mechanical tension is critical in maintaining proper function in neurons, but its role in transport is not well understood. To this end, we investigate the active and passive transport of vesicles in Aplysia neurons while changing neurite tension via applied strain and quantify the resulting dynamics. We found that tension in neurons modulates active transport of vesicles by increasing the probability of active motion, effective diffusivity and induces a retrograde bias. We show that mechanical tension modulates active transport processes in neurons and that external forces can couple to internal (subcellular) forces and change the overall transport dynamics.},

  abstract = {The regulation of the quantities and types of organelles that leave the neuronal cell body destined for use in the axon and its terminals is not well understood. We had previously found that transport of transmitter undergoes a precise down regulation when most of one branch of the bifurcate axon of an identified serotonergic neuron was removed. We have now investigated further the nature of the regulatory event and the reason for its initiation by eliminating portions of the axonal tree of this neuron. We find that the down regulation is more likely to be due to the loss of synapses than of axon because transport of [3H]serotonin decreases as much when an axonal branch is transected distally as after a proximal transection. Transport of [3H]fucosyl glycoprotein, which normally is associated with the serotonergic vesicle in this axon, decreases to the same extent as transport of [3H]serotonin following proximal transection. The glycoprotein down regulation occurs much more rapidly, possibly due to an inhibition of vesicle synthesis. A secondary rise in transport of [3H] fucosyl glycoprotein 3 days to 2 weeks after axotomy suggests that the radiolabeled glycoprotein has undergone a redistribution into organelles not normally labeled and transported in intact neurons in large amounts, since [3H]serotonin transport remains stably diminished during this period. We also describe here a case of routing of rapidly transported material. When one axonal branch is cut far from the point of bifurcation (approximately 10 mm), [3H]serotonin is directed away from the ranch lacking its synaptic terminals and into the remaining intact branch even though the transected branch is physically capable of transporting its normal amount of [3H]serotonin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Such collective transport could utilize mechanisms which emerge from inter-motor interactions in ways that are yet to be fully understood. Here we combined experimental measurements of two-kinesin transport with a theoretical framework to investigate the functional ramifications of inter-motor interactions on individual motor function and collective cargo transport. In contrast to kinesin's low sidestepping frequency when present as a single motor, with exactly two kinesins per cargo, we observed substantial motion perpendicular to the microtubule. Our model captures a surface-associated mode of kinesin, which is only accessible via inter-motor interference in groups, in which kinesin diffuses along the microtubule surface and rapidly ``hops'' between protofilaments without dissociating from the microtubule. Critically, each kinesin transitions dynamically between the active stepping mode and this weak surface-associated mode enhancing local exploration of the microtubule surface, possibly enabling cellular cargos to overcome macromolecular crowding and to navigate obstacles along microtubule tracks without sacrificing overall travel distance.},

Post-translational modifications of the protein substrate, such as phosphorylation or hydroxylation, are often required prior to its selection. In this way, the precise spatio-temporal targeting and degradation of a given substrate can be achieved. The E3s are a large, diverse group of proteins, characterized by one of several defining motifs. These include a HECT (homologous to E6-associated protein C-terminus), RING (really interesting new gene) or U-box (a modified RING motif without the full complement of Zn2+-binding ligands) domain. Whereas HECT E3s have a direct role in catalysis during ubiquitination, RING and U-box E3s facilitate protein ubiquitination. These latter two E3 types act as adaptor-like molecules. They bring an E2 and a substrate into sufficiently close proximity to promote the substrate's ubiquitination. Although many RING-type E3s, such as MDM2 (murine double minute clone 2 oncoprotein) and c-Cbl, can apparently act alone, others are found as components of much larger multi-protein complexes, such as the anaphase-promoting complex. Taken together, these multifaceted properties and interactions enable E3s to provide a powerful, and specific, mechanism for protein clearance within all cells of eukaryotic organisms. The importance of E3s is highlighted by the number of normal cellular processes they regulate, and the number of diseases associated with their loss of function or inappropriate targeting.}

Here, we show that the Slp1/Rab27B/CRMP-2 complex directly links TrkB to Kinesin-1, and that this association is required for the anterograde transport of TrkB-containing vesicles. The cytoplasmic tail of TrkB binds to Slp1 in a Rab27B-dependent manner, and CRMP-2 connects Slp1 to Kinesin-1. Knockdown of these molecules by siRNA reduces the anterograde transport and membrane targeting of TrkB, thereby inhibiting BDNF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in axons.

In this study, using both biochemical and morphological methods, we show that the granules contain tau mRNA, HuD RNA-binding protein, which stabilizes mRNA, and KIF3A, a member of the kinesin microtubule-associated motor protein family involved in anterograde transport. The granules are detected along the axon and accumulate in the growth cone. Inhibition of KIF3A expression caused neurite retraction and inhibited tau mRNA axonal targeting. Taken together, these results suggest that HuD and KIF3A proteins are present in the tau mRNA axonal granules and suggest an additional function for the kinesin motor family in the microtubule-dependent translocation of RNA granules. Localized tau-GFP expression was blocked by a protein synthesis inhibitor, and upon release from inhibition, nascent tau-GFP`hot spots' were directly observed in the axon and growth cones. These observations are consistent with local protein synthesis in the axon resulting from the transported tau mRNA.}

Two broad classes of model have been invoked to explain kinesin movement: hand-over-hand and inchworm. In hand-over-hand models, the heads exchange leading and trailing roles with every step, whereas no such exchange is postulated for inchworm models, where one head always leads. By measuring the stepwise motion of individual enzymes, we find that some kinesin molecules exhibit a marked alternation in the dwell times between sequential steps, causing these motors to ``limp'' along the microtubule. Limping implies that kinesin molecules strictly alternate between two different conformations as they step, indicative of an asymmetric, hand-over-hand mechanism.}

Roughly equal proportions of these microtubules are oriented with (+)-ends directed toward the growth cone and (+)-ends directed toward the cell body. At distances within 15 micron of the growth cone, however, microtubule polarity orientation in dendrites is similar to that in axons; (+)-ends are uniformly directed toward the growth cone.

About half of the microtubules have their plus ends oriented distal to the cell body, and the other half have their minus ends distal; in contrast, microtubules in the axon are of uniform polarity orientation, all having their plus ends distal (Baas, P.W., J.S. Deitch, M. M. Black, and G. A. Banker. 1988. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 85:8335-8339). Here we describe the developmental changes that give rise to the distinct microtubule patterns of axons and dendrites. Cultured hippocampal neurons initially extend several short processes, any one of which can apparently become the axon (Dotti, C. G., and G. A. Banker. 1987. Nature [Lond.]. 330:477-479). A few days after the axon has begun its rapid growth, the remaining processes differentiate into dendrites (Dotti, C. G., C. A. Sullivan, and G. A. Banker. 1988. J. Neurosci. 8:1454-1468). The polarity orientation of the microtubules in all of the initial processes is uniform, with plus ends distal to the cell body, even through most of these processes will become dendrites. This uniform microtubule polarity orientation is maintained in the axon at all stages of its growth. The polarity orientation of the microtubules in the other processes remains uniform until they begin to grow and acquire the morphological characteristics of dendrites. It is during this period that microtubules with minus ends distal to the cell body first appear in these processes. The proportion of minus end-distal microtubules gradually increases until, by 7 d in culture, about equal numbers of dendritic microtubules are oriented in each direction. Thus, the establishment of regional differences in microtubule polarity orientation occurs after the initial polarization of the neuron and is temporally correlated with the differentiation of the dendrites.},

In an early model, it was proposed that microtubules are actively transported from the cell body of the neuron down the length of the axon. This model has been contested over the years in favor of very different models based on stationary microtubules. It appears that a corner has finally been turned in this long-standing controversy. It is now clear that cells contain molecular motor proteins capable of transporting microtubules and that microtubule transport is an essential component in the formation of microtubule arrays across many cells types. A wide variety of cell biological approaches have provided strong indirect evidence that microtubules are indeed transported within axons, and new live-cell imaging approaches are beginning to permit the direct visualization of this transport. The molecules and mechanisms that transport microtubules within axons are also under intense study. \textcopyright{} 2002 Academic Press.},

How local synaptogenic signals intercept synaptic cargo in transport to promote its delivery and synapse formation is unknown. We found that the control of synaptic cargo delivery at microtubule (MT) minus ends mediates pro- and anti-synaptogenic activities of presynaptic neurexin and frizzled in C.~elegans and identified the atypical kinesin VAB-8/KIF26 as a key molecule in this process. VAB-8/KIF26 levels at synaptic MT minus ends are controlled by frizzled and neurexin; loss of VAB-8 mimics neurexin mutants or frizzled hyperactivation, and its overexpression can rescue synapse loss in these backgrounds. VAB-8/KIF26 is required for the synaptic localization of other minus-end proteins and promotes the pausing of retrograde transport to allow delivery to synapses. Consistently, reducing retrograde transport rescues synapse loss in vab-8 and neurexin mutants. These results uncover a mechanistic link between synaptogenic signaling and axonal transport.},

Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we measured the anomalous diffusion exponent {$\alpha$} characterizing the dependence of the mean-square displacement of the tracer proteins on time, {$\langle$}r2(t){$\rangle\sim$}t{$\alpha$}. We observed that the diffusion of proteins in dextran solutions with concentrations up to 400g/l is subdiffusive ({$\alpha<$}1) even at low obstacle concentration. The anomalous diffusion exponent {$\alpha$} decreases continuously with increasing obstacle concentration and molecular weight, but does not depend on buffer ionic strength, and neither does it depend strongly on solution temperature. At very high random-coil polymer concentrations, {$\alpha$} reaches a limit value of {$\alpha$}l{$\approx$}3/4, which we take to be the signature of a coupling between the motions of the tracer proteins and the segments of the dextran chains. A similar, although less pronounced, subdiffusive behavior is observed for the diffusion of streptavidin in concentrated globular protein solutions. These observations indicate that protein diffusion in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus should be anomalous as well, with consequences for measurements of solute diffusion coefficients in cells and for the modeling of cellular processes relying on diffusion.},

Here we show that their anterograde transport in Drosophila larval ganglion is microtubule-dependent and occurs in two different time profiles. AChE transport is constitutive while that of ChAT occurs in a brief pulse during third instar larva stage. Mutations in the kinesin-2 motor subunit Klp64D and separate siRNA-mediated knock-outs of all the three kinesin-2 subunits disrupt the ChAT and AChE transports, and these antigens accumulate in discrete nonoverlapping punctae in neuronal cell bodies and axons. Quantification analysis further showed that mutations in Klp64D could independently affect the anterograde transport of AChE even before that of ChAT. Finally, ChAT and AChE were coimmunoprecipitated with the kinesin-2 subunits but not with each other. Altogether, these suggest that kinesin-2 independently transports AChE and ChAT within the same axon. It also implies that cargo availability could regulate the rate and frequency of transports by kinesin motors. \textcopyright{} 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Neurobiol, 2006},

  abstract = {c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) (comprising JNK1\textendash 3 isoforms) are members of the MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) family, activated in response to various stimuli including growth factors and inflammatory cytokines. Their activation is facilitated by scaffold proteins, notably JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP1). Originally considered to be mediators of neuronal degeneration in response to stress and injury, recent studies support a role of JNKs in early stages of neurite outgrowth, including adult axonal regeneration. However, the function of individual JNK isoforms, and their potential effector molecules, remained unknown. Here, we analyzed the role of JNK signaling during axonal regeneration from adult mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, combining pharmacological JNK inhibition and mice deficient for each JNK isoform and for JIP1. We demonstrate that neuritogenesis is delayed by lack of JNK2 and JNK3, but not JNK1. JNK signaling is further required for sustained neurite elongation, as pharmacological JNK inhibition resulted in massive neurite retraction. This function relies on JNK1 and JNK2. Neurite regeneration of jip1-/- DRG neurons is affected at both initiation and extension stages. Interestingly, activated JNKs (phospho-JNKs), as well as JIP1, are also present in the cytoplasm of sprouting or regenerating axons, suggesting a local action on cytoskeleton proteins. Indeed, we have shown that JNK1 and JNK2 regulate the phosphorylation state of microtubule-associated protein MAP1B, whose role in axonal regeneration was previously characterized. Moreover, lack of MAP1B prevents neurite retraction induced by JNK inhibition. Thus, signaling by individual JNKs is differentially implicated in the reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and neurite regeneration.},

  abstract = {Neuronal injury often leads to devastating consequences such as loss of senses or locomotion. Restoration of function after injury relies on whether the injured axons can find their target cells. Although fusion between injured proximal axon and distal fragment has been observed in many organisms, its functional significance is not clear. Here, using Caenorhabditis elegans mechanosensory neurons, we address this question. Using two femtosecond lasers simultaneously, we could scan and sever posterior lateral microtubule neurons [posterior lateral microtubules (PLMs)] on both sides of the worm. We showed that axotomy of both PLMs leads to a dramatic loss of posterior touch sensation. During the regenerative phase, only axons that fuse to their distal counterparts contribute to functional recovery. Loss of let-7 miRNA promotes functional restoration in both larval and adult stages. In the L4 stage, loss of let-7 increases fusion events by increasing the mRNA level of one of the cell-recognition molecules, CED-7. The ability to establish cytoplasmic continuity between the proximal and distal ends declines with age. Loss of let-7 overcomes this barrier by promoting axonal transport and enrichment of the EFF-1 fusogen at the growing tip of cut processes. Our data reveal the functional property of a regenerating neuron.},

Using biochemical in vitro reconstitutions with purified mammalian proteins, multicolor TIRF-microscopy, and interaction kinetics measurements, we show that adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) enables kinesin-1- and kinesin-2-based mRNA transport, and that APC is an ideal adaptor for long-range mRNA transport as it forms highly stable complexes with 3{${'}$}UTR fragments of several neuronal mRNAs (APC\textendash RNPs). The kinesin-1 KIF5A binds and transports several neuronal mRNP components such as FMRP, PUR{$\alpha$} and mRNA fragments weakly, whereas the transport frequency of the mRNA fragments is significantly increased by APC. APC\textendash RNP-motor complexes can assemble on MTs, generating highly processive mRNA transport events. We further find that end-binding protein 1 (EB1) recruits APC\textendash RNPs to dynamically growing MT ends and APC\textendash RNPs track shrinking MTs, producing MT minus-end-directed RNA motility due to the high dwell times of APC on MTs. Our findings establish APC as a versatile mRNA-kinesin adaptor and a key factor for the assembly and bidirectional movement of neuronal transport mRNPs.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The progressive nature of Wallerian degeneration has long been controversial. Conflicting reports that distal stumps of injured axons degenerate anterogradely, retrogradely, or simultaneously are based on statistical observations at discontinuous locations within the nerve, without observing any single axon at two distant points. As axon degeneration is asynchronous, there are clear advantages to longitudinal studies of individual degenerating axons. We recently validated the study of Wallerian degeneration using yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in a small, representative population of axons, which greatly improves longitudinal imaging. Here, we apply this method to study the progressive nature of Wallerian degeneration in both wild-type and slow Wallerian degeneration (WldS) mutant mice. RESULTS: In wild-type nerves, we directly observed partially fragmented axons (average 5.3\%) among a majority of fully intact or degenerated axons 37-42 h after transection and 40-44 h after crush injury. Axons exist in this state only transiently, probably for less than one hour. Surprisingly, axons degenerated anterogradely after transection but retrogradely after a crush, but in both cases a sharp boundary separated intact and fragmented regions of individual axons, indicating that Wallerian degeneration progresses as a wave sequentially affecting adjacent regions of the axon. In contrast, most or all WldS axons were partially fragmented 15-25 days after nerve lesion, WldS axons degenerated anterogradely independent of lesion type, and signs of degeneration increased gradually along the nerve instead of abruptly. Furthermore, the first signs of degeneration were short constrictions, not complete breaks. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that Wallerian degeneration progresses rapidly along individual wild-type axons after a heterogeneous latent phase. The speed of progression and its ability to travel in either direction challenges earlier models in which clearance of trophic or regulatory factors by axonal transport triggers degeneration. WldS axons, once they finally degenerate, do so by a fundamentally different mechanism, indicated by differences in the rate, direction and abruptness of progression, and by different early morphological signs of degeneration. These observations suggest that WldS axons undergo a slow anterograde decay as axonal components are gradually depleted, and do not simply follow the degeneration pathway of wild-type axons at a slower rate.},

It remains unclear how a dynein dimer is able to transport cargos against load without coordinating the stepping cycles of its two heads. Here by using a DNA-tethered optical trapping geometry, we find that the force-generating step of a head occurs in the MT-bound state, while the `primed' unbound state is highly diffusional and only weakly biased to step towards the MT-minus end. The stall forces of the individual heads are additive, with both heads contributing equally to the maximal force production of the dimer. On the basis of these results, we propose that the heads of dynein utilize a `load-sharing' mechanism, unlike kinesin and myosin. This mechanism may allow dynein to work against hindering forces larger than the maximal force produced by a single head.},

We have prepared truncated kinesin derivatives that contain either two mechanochemical head domains3 or only a single head. Unlike intact kinesin and the two-headed derivatives, the one-headed enzyme frequently fails to track protofilaments, suggesting that it detaches from microtubules during movement. In this way, the one-headed kinesin derivative is similar to the motor enzyme myosin, which frequently detaches from the actin filament during movement4. For myosin (which has two heads), the consequence of this detachment is that single molecules do not appear to drive continuous movement along the filament5. Our observations suggest that the ability of single two-headed kinesin molecules to drive continuous movement6,7 results from a 'hand-over-hand' mechanism6\textendash 8 in which one head remains bound to the microtubule while the other detaches and moves forwards.},

  abstract = {Kinesin-3 KIF1A (UNC-104 in C. elegans) is the major fast axonal transporter of STVs (synaptic vesicle protein transport vesicles) containing synaptic precursors such as RAB3A (RAB-3) or VAMP2 (SNB-1). Heritable mutations in neuronal motor proteins (and their adaptors) lead to numerous neurodegenerative diseases. The C-terminal PH (pleckstrin homolog) domain of kinesin-3 UNC-104 directly binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphates that form the lipid bilayers of STVs. We hypothesized that RAB-3-bound STVs employ a dual linker UNC-10/SYD-2 (RIMS1/liprin-{$\alpha$} in mammals) acting as a UNC-104 receptor. This tripartite RAB-3/UNC-10/SYD-2 complex would also act as an additional linker to strengthen the motor-lipid interaction. RT-PCR and Western blot experiments favor a genetic relation between SYD-2, UNC-10 and RAB-3. Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed changes in binding affinities between SYD-2 and UNC-104 depending on the presence or absence of UNC-10 and RAB-3. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays revealed in situ interaction changes between SYD-2 and UNC-104 in either unc-10 or rab-3 mutants. Neuronal expression of UNC-104 appears to be more diffused and is restricted to travel short distances with significantly reduced speeds in these mutants. Though both SNB-1 and RAB-3 are actively transported by UNC-104, the movement of RAB-3 is generally enhanced and largely depending on the presence of the dual linker. Strikingly, the deletion of UNC-104's PH domain did not affect UNC-104/RAB-3 colocalization but did affect UNC-104/SNB-1 colocalization. These findings solidly support the model of a dual UNC-10/SYD-2 linker acting as a sufficient buttress to connect the motor to RAB-3-containing STVs to enhance their transport. SCIENTIFIC STATEMENT The interaction between molecular motors and their membranous vesicular cargoes is generally specific. However, for the major axonal transporter kinesin-3 UNC-104, only its weak and non-specific interaction via phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphates (forming the lipid bilayers of synaptic vesicles) has been characterized. Here, we present a novel, more specific way for UNC-104 to interact with synaptic vesicles - specifically with RAB-3 bound vesicles - via the dual linker complex UNC-10/SYD-2. Because many neurological diseases are linked to defects in axonal trafficking (often with protein accumulation phenotypes in neurons), understanding the molecular basis of motor/vesicle interaction might lead to the design of new drugs that may cure or prevent such diseases.},

  abstract = {Delivery of neurotrophins and neuropeptides via long-range trafficking of dense core vesicles (DCVs) from the cell soma to nerve terminals is essential for synapse modulation and circuit function. But the mechanism by which transiting DCVs are captured at specific sites is unknown. Here, we discovered that Synaptotagmin-4 (Syt4) regulates the capture and spatial distribution of DCVs in hippocampal neurons. We found that DCVs are highly mobile and undergo long-range translocation but switch directions only at the distal ends of axons, revealing a circular trafficking pattern. Phosphorylation of serine 135 of Syt4 by JNK steers DCV trafficking by destabilizing Syt4-Kif1A interaction, leading to a transition from microtubule-dependent DCV trafficking to capture at en passant presynaptic boutons by actin. Furthermore, neuronal activity increased DCV capture via JNK-dependent phosphorylation of the S135 site of Syt4. Our data reveal a mechanism that ensures rapid, site-specific delivery of DCVs to synapses.},

  abstract = {Bidirectional membrane trafficking along microtubules is mediated by kinesin-1, kinesin-3, and dynein. Several organelle-bound adapters for kinesin-1 and dynein have been reported that orchestrate their opposing activity. However, the coordination of kinesin-3/dynein-mediated transport is not understood. In this paper, we report that a Hook protein, Hok1, is essential for kinesin-3\textendash{} and dynein-dependent early endosome (EE) motility in the fungus Ustilago maydis. Hok1 binds to EEs via its C-terminal region, where it forms a complex with homologues of human fused toes (FTS) and its interactor FTS- and Hook-interacting protein. A highly conserved N-terminal region is required to bind dynein and kinesin-3 to EEs. To change the direction of EE transport, kinesin-3 is released from organelles, and dynein binds subsequently. A chimaera of human Hook3 and Hok1 rescues the hok1 mutant phenotype, suggesting functional conservation between humans and fungi. We conclude that Hok1 is part of an evolutionarily conserved protein complex that regulates bidirectional EE trafficking by controlling attachment of both kinesin-3 and dynein.}

However, a relative paucity of polysomes (considered the active sites of translation) detected in electron micrographs of neuronal processes has suggested a limited capacity for local protein synthesis. In this study, we used polysome profiling together with ribosome footprinting of microdissected rodent synaptic regions to reveal a surprisingly high number of dendritic and/or axonal transcripts preferentially associated with monosomes (single ribosomes). Furthermore, the neuronal monosomes were in the process of active protein synthesis. Most mRNAs showed a similar translational status in the cell bodies and neurites, but some transcripts exhibited differential ribosome occupancy in the compartments. Monosome-preferring transcripts often encoded high-abundance synaptic proteins. Thus, monosome translation contributes to the local neuronal proteome.}

On a per mole basis, twice-cycled microtubules from white matter contained three times more tau than did twice-cycled microtubules from gray matter. Immunohistochemical studies that compared the localization of tau with that of MAP2 and tubulin demonstrated that tau was restricted to axons, extending the results of the biochemical studies. Tau localization was not observed in glia, which indicated that, at least in brain, tau is neuron specific. These observations indicate that tau may help define a subpopulation of microtubules that is restricted to axons. Furthermore, the monoclonal antibody described in this report should prove very useful to investigators studying axonal sprouting and growth because it is an exclusive axonal marker.},

The trafficking of individual synaptic proteins has been seen before, but the observation that a major cell biological machine traffics into spines to change synapses is new, and perhaps counterintuitive.

  abstract = {SYNOPSIS. Severed distal stumps of nerve axons have now been reported to survive for months to years in both vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems While low (\&gt;15\textdegree C) temperatures may increase survival times in some preparations such as unmyelinated garfish olfactory axons, temperature between 15 and 25\textdegree C is not the only significant factor determining the time course of survival in goldfish Mauthner axons and for many invertebrate axons For example when different axons in a crayfish are all studied at the same temperature, long term survival differs in different axons In some cases these differences appear to be due to differences in the nature of the ghal reaction or the presence of synaptic contacts.The possible cellular mechanisms for long term survival fall into three general cate gories slow degradation of axonal proteins de novo axoplasmic protein synthesis, and transfer of proteins from adjacent cells to severed axonal stumps In crayfish and squid giant axons, there is evidence that proteins are indeed transferred intact from glia to axons or from axon to axon, possibly via exocytotic/endocytotic processes However cellular mechanisms for long term survival may well differ in different axons of the same organism, much less between axons in organisms from different phyla In particular the ghal sheaths of myehnated vertebrate axons which demonstrate long term survival might be expected to impede ghal/axonal or axonal/axonal protein transfer.The study of long term survival of severed distal stumps is important for studies of axonal regeneration because axons in organisms having long survival times often show functional reconnection much more rapidly and with higher specificity than do axons in organisms lacking long survival times The study of long term survival is also important to cell biologists for an understanding of the molecular mechanisms which allow a piece of cytoplasm separated from direct cytoplasmic contact with any nucleus to remain morphologically intact and functionally competent for months to years.}

The slowest group of proteins, designated slow component a (SCa), has a transport rate of 0.25 mm/d and consists of tubulin and neurofilament protein. The other slowly transported group of proteins, designated slow components b (SCb), has a transport rate of 2-3 mm/d and consists of many polypeptides, one of which is actin (4). Our analyses of the transport kinetics of the individual polypeptides of SCa and SCb indicate that (a) the polypeptides of SCa are transported coherently in the optic axons, (b) the polypeptides of SCb are also transported coherently but completely separately from the SCa polypeptides, and (c) the polypeptides of SCa differ completely from those comprising SCb. We relate these results to our general hypothesis that slow axonal transport represents the movements of structural complexes of proteins. Furthermore, it is proposed that SCa corresponds to the microtubule-neurofilament network, and that SCb represents the transport of the microfilament network together with the proteins complexed with microfilaments.}

Kinesin-dependent transport plays a critical role in neurogenesis and neuronal function due to the large distance separating the soma and nerve terminal. The fate of kinesin motors after delivery of their cargoes is unknown but has been postulated to involve degradation at the nerve terminal, recycling via retrograde motors, and/or recycling via diffusion. We set out to test these models concerning the fate of kinesin-1 motors after completion of transport in neuronal cells. We find that kinesin-1 motors are neither degraded nor returned by retrograde motors. By combining mathematical modeling and experimental analysis, we propose a model in which the distribution and recycling of kinesin-1 motors fits a ``loose bucket brigade'' where individual motors alter between periods of active transport and free diffusion within neuronal processes. These results suggest that individual kinesin-1 motors are utilized for multiple rounds of transport.},

The products consistently contained 124,000 (124K) and 64,000 (64K) dalton polypeptides. These two polypeptides appear to represent heavy and light chains of kinesin, respectively, because they copurified on sucrose gradients to a constant and equimolar stoichiometry and bound stably to microtubules in the presence of AMP-PNP but not ATP. The mobilities of 124K and 64K in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions were the same as under nonreducing conditions. A diffusion coefficient of (2.24 +/- 0.21) X 10(-7) cm2 s-1 and a sedimentation coefficient of (9.56 +/- 0.34) X 10(-13) s were determined for native kinesin by gel filtration and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, respectively. These values were used to calculate a native molecular weight of about 379,000 and suggest that kinesin has an axial ratio of approximately 20. Extensively purified kinesin exhibited microtubule-activated ATPase activity, and only the 124K subunit incorporated ATP in photoaffinity labeling experiments using [32P]ATP. Collectively, these data favor the interpretation that bovine brain kinesin is a highly elongated, microtubule-activated ATPase comprising two subunits each of 124,000 and 64,000 daltons, that the subunits are not linked to one another by disulfide bonds, and that the heavy chains are the ATP-binding subunits.},

At least one of these human homologs can function in C. elegans, suggesting that it, like UNC-76, acts in axonal outgrowth.

  abstract = {Proteasomes are large multisubunit proteases that are found in the cytosol, both free and attached to the endoplasmic reticulum, and in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Their ubiquitous presence and high abundance in these compartments reflects their central role in cellular protein turnover. Proteasomes recognize, unfold, and digest protein substrates that have been marked for degradation by the attachment of a ubiquitin moiety. Individual subcomplexes of the complete 26S proteasome are involved in these different tasks: The ATP-dependent 19S caps are believed to unfold substrates and feed them to the actual protease, the 20S proteasome. This core particle appears to be more ancient than the ubiquitin system. Both prokaryotic and archaebacterial ancestors have been identified. Crystal structures are now available for the E. coli proteasome homologue and the T. acidophilum and S. cerevisiae 20S proteasomes. All three enzymes are cylindrical particles that have their active sites on the inner walls of a large central cavity. They share the fold and a novel catalytic mechanism with an N-terminal nucleophilic threonine, which places them in the family of Ntn (N terminal nucleophile) hydrolases. Evolution has added complexity to the comparatively simple prokaryotic prototype. This minimal proteasome is a homododecamer made from two hexameric rings stacked head to head. Its heptameric version is the catalytic core of archaebacterial proteasomes, where it is sandwiched between two inactive antichambers that are made up from a different subunit. In eukaryotes, both subunits have diverged into seven different subunits each, which are present in the particle in unique locations such that a complex dimer is formed that has six active sites with three major specificities that can be attributed to individual subunits. Genetic, biochemical, and high-resolution electron microscopy data, but no crystal structures, are available for the 19S caps. A first step toward a mechanistic understanding of proteasome activation and regulation has been made with the elucidation of the X-ray structure of the alternative, mammalian proteasome activator PA28.},

We found that the most common LRRK2 mutation, LRRK2-G2019S, dramatically reduces the processivity of autophagosome transport in neurons in a kinase-dependent manner. This effect was consistent across an overexpression model, neurons from a G2019S knockin mouse, and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons gene edited to express the G2019S mutation, and the effect was reversed by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2. Furthermore, LRRK2 hyperactivation induced by overexpression of Rab29, a known activator of LRRK2 kinase, disrupted autophagosome transport to a similar extent. Mechanistically, we found that hyperactive LRRK2 recruits the motor adaptor JNK-interacting protein 4 (JIP4) to the autophagosomal membrane, inducing abnormal activation of kinesin that we propose leads to an unproductive tug of war between anterograde and retrograde motors. Disruption of autophagosome transport correlated with a significant defect in autophagosome acidification, suggesting that the observed transport deficit impairs effective degradation of autophagosomal cargo in neurons. Our results robustly link increased LRRK2 kinase activity to defects in autophagosome transport and maturation, further implicating defective autophagy in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.},

Here, we show that DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer), a receptor for the axon guidance cue netrin-1, is distributed both at the plasma membrane and in a pre-existing intracellular vesicular pool in embryonic rat spinal commissural neurons. We hypothesized that the intracellular pool of DCC could be mobilized to the plasma membrane and enhance the response to netrin-1. Consistent with this, we show that application of netrin-1 causes a modest increase in cell surface DCC, without increasing the intracellular concentration of cAMP or activating PKA. Intriguingly, activation of PKA enhances the effect of netrin-1 on DCC mobilization and increases axon extension in response to netrin-1. PKA-dependent mobilization of DCC to the plasma membrane is selective, because the distributions of transient axonal glycoprotein-1, neural cell adhesion molecule, and trkB are not altered by PKA in these cells. Inhibiting adenylate cyclase, PKA, or exocytosis blocks DCC translocation on PKA activation. These findings indicate that netrin-1 increases the amount of cell surface DCC, that PKA potentiates the mobilization of DCC to the neuronal plasma membrane from an intracellular vesicular store, and that translocation of DCC to the cell surface increases axon outgrowth in response to netrin-1.},

  abstract = {The causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected millions and killed hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, highlighting an urgent need to develop antiviral therapies. Here we present a quantitative mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics survey of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells, revealing dramatic rewiring of phosphorylation on host and viral proteins. SARS-CoV-2 infection promoted casein kinase II (CK2) and p38 MAPK activation, production of diverse cytokines, and shutdown of mitotic kinases, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Infection also stimulated a marked induction of CK2-containing filopodial protrusions possessing budding viral particles. Eighty-seven drugs and compounds were identified by mapping global phosphorylation profiles to dysregulated kinases and pathways. We found pharmacologic inhibition of the p38, CK2, CDK, AXL, and PIKFYVE kinases to possess antiviral efficacy, representing potential COVID-19 therapies.},

  abstract = {Selective protein degradation is a key regulator of neuronal development and synaptogenesis. Complexes that target proteins for degradation often contain F-box proteins. Here we characterize MEC-15, an F-box protein with WD repeats, which is required for the development and function of Caenorhabditis elegans touch receptor neurons (TRNs). Mutations in mec-15 produce defects in TRN touch sensitivity, chemical synapse formation, and cell-body morphology. All mec-15 mutant phenotypes are enhanced by mutations in a MAP kinase pathway composed of the MAPKKK DLK-1, the MAPKK MKK-4, and the p38 MAPK PMK-3. A mutation of the rpm-1 gene, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that negatively regulates this pathway to promote synaptogenesis, suppresses only the mec-15 cell-body defect. Thus, MEC-15 acts in parallel with RPM-1, implicating a second protein degradation pathway in TRN development. In addition, all mec-15 phenotypes can be dominantly suppressed by mutations in mec-7, which encodes a beta-tubulin, and dominantly enhanced by mutations in mec-12, which encodes an alpha-tubulin. Since mec-15 phenotypes depend on the relative levels of these tubulins, MEC-15 may target proteins whose function is affected by these levels.},

Myosin and dynein, other ATPases known to be involved in cell motility, have properties that are inconsistent with the established properties of fast axonal transport1,2, an essential component of which is readily solubilized in physiological buffer conditions rather than being stably associated with either membranous organelles3 or cytoskeletal elements4. Adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP\textendash PNP), a nonhydrolysable analogue of ATP, is a potent inhibitor of fast axonal transport that results in a stable interaction of membranous organelles with microtubules1,2. Here we report the identification and partial characterization of an ATPase activity from brain whose binding to microtubules is stabilized by AMP-PNP. This ATPase activity seems to be associated with a polypeptide of relative molecular mass (Mr)130,000 that is highly enriched in microtubule pellets after incubation with AMP-PNP and a soluble fraction from chick brain. This novel ATPase fraction has the predicted characteristics of the motor involved in fast axonal transport. Common features between the ATPase and fast axonal transport include interaction with the cytoskeleton in the presence of AMP-PNP, ready extractability, no Ca2+ dependence and inhibition by EDTA1,5.},

  abstract = {One of our monoclonal antibodies against the heavy chain of bovine kinesin (H2) also recognized the heavy chain of squid kinesin. The immunofluorescence pattern of H2 in axoplasm was similar to that seen in mammalian cells with antibodies specific for kinesin light and heavy chains, indicating that squid kinesin is also concentrated on membrane-bounded organelles. Although kinesin is assumed to be a motor for translocation of membrane-bounded organelles in fast axonal transport, direct evidence has been lacking. Perfusion of axoplasm with purified H2 at 0.1-0.4 mg/ml resulted in a profound inhibition of both the rates and number of organelles moving in anterograde and retrograde directions in the interior of the axoplasm, and comparable inhibition was noted in bidirectional movement along individual microtubules at the periphery. Maximal inhibition developed over 30-60 min. Perfusion with higher concentrations of H2 (greater than 1 mg of IgG per ml) were less effective, whereas perfusion with 0.04 mg of H2 per ml resulted in minimal inhibition. Movement of membrane-bounded organelles after perfusion with comparable levels of irrelevant mouse IgG (0.04 to greater than 1 mg/ml) were not distinguishable from perfusion with buffer controls. Inhibition of fast axonal transport by an antibody specific for kinesin provides direct evidence that kinesin is involved in the translocation of membrane-bounded organelles in axons. Moreover, the inhibition of bidirectional axonal transport by H2 raises the possibility that kinesin may play some role in both anterograde and retrograde axonal transport.}

This is a direct consequence of thermal agitation, and leads to diffusion of molecules and small particles in a liquid. In addition to this nondirected motion, living cells also use active transport mechanisms, such as motor activity and polymerization forces that depend on linear biopolymers and are therefore fundamentally directed in nature. Nevertheless, it has become increasingly clear that such active processes can also drive significant random fluctuations that can appear surprisingly like thermal diffusion of particles, but faster. Here, we discuss recent progress in quantifying this behavior and identifying its origins and consequences. We suggest that it represents an important and biologically tunable mechanism for transport in living cells.},

Many of these structures behave as condensed liquid-like phases of the cytoplasm/nucleoplasm. The phase transitions that appear to govern their assembly exhibit an intrinsic dependence on cell size, and may explain the size scaling reported for a number of structures. This size scaling could, in turn, play a role in cell growth and size control.}

Individual severed axons and growth cones can translate proteins and also export them to the cell surface. As axons reach the spinal cord midline, EphA2 is among the receptors upregulated on at least some distal axon segments. Midline reporter upregulation is recapitulated by part of the EphA2 mRNA 3' untranslated region, which is highly conserved and includes known translational control sequences. These results show axons contain all the machinery for protein translation and cell surface expression, and they reveal a potentially general and flexible RNA-based mechanism for regulation localized within a subregion of the axon.},

Previous work has identified dynein as the minus-end-directed motor for late endosome/lysosome localization and dynamics. Conventional kinesin (kinesin-1) has been implicated in plus-end-directed late endosome/lysosome movement, but other kinesin family members may also be involved. Kinesin-2 is known to drive the movement of pigment granules, a type of lysosomally derived organelle, and was recently found to be associated with purified late endosomes. To determine whether kinesin-2 might also power endosome movement in non-pigmented cells, we overexpressed dominant negative forms of the KIF3A motor subunit and KAP3 accessory subunit and knocked down KAP3 levels using RNAi. We found kinesin-2 to be required for the normal steady-state localization of late endosomes/lysosomes but not early endosomes or recycling endosomes. Despite the abnormal subcellular distribution of late endosomes/lysosomes, the uptake and trafficking of molecules through the conventional endocytic pathway appeared to be unaffected. The slow time\textendash course of inhibition suggests that both kinesin-2 itself and its attachment to membranes do not turn over quickly.},

E2 and RING E3 enzymes often collaborate to first prime a substrate with a single ubiquitin (UB) and then achieve different forms of polyubiquitination: multiubiquitination of several sites and elongation of linkage-specific UB chains. Here, cryo-EM and biochemistry show that the human E3 anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) and its two partner E2s, UBE2C (aka UBCH10) and UBE2S, adopt specialized catalytic architectures for these two distinct forms of polyubiquitination. The APC/C RING constrains UBE2C proximal to a substrate and simultaneously binds a substrate-linked UB to drive processive multiubiquitination. Alternatively, during UB chain elongation, the RING does not bind UBE2S but rather lures an evolving substrate-linked UB to UBE2S positioned through a cullin interaction to generate a Lys11-linked chain. Our findings define mechanisms of APC/C regulation, and establish principles by which specialized E3-E2-substrate-UB architectures control different forms of polyubiquitination.},

The 26S proteasome can be divided into two subcomplexes: the 19S regulatory particle and the 20S core particle. Most substrates are first covalently modified by ubiquitin, which then directs them to the proteasome. The function of the regulatory particle is to recognize, unfold, deubiquitylate, and translocate substrates into the core particle, which contains the proteolytic sites of the proteasome. Given the abundance and subunit complexity of the proteasome, the assembly of this \textasciitilde 2.5MDa complex must be carefully orchestrated to ensure its correct formation. In recent years, significant progress has been made in the understanding of proteasome assembly, structure, and function. Technical advances in cryo-electron microscopy have resulted in a series of atomic cryo-electron microscopy structures of both human and yeast 26S proteasomes.

Mutations that decreased ubiquitination of GLR-1 increased the abundance of GLR-1 at synapses and altered locomotion behavior in a manner that is consistent with increased synaptic strength. By contrast, overexpression of ubiquitin decreased the abundance of GLR-1 at synapses and decreased the density of GLR-1-containing synapses, and these effects were prevented by mutations in the unc-11 gene, which encodes a clathrin adaptin protein (AP180). These results suggest that ubiquitination of GLR-1 receptors regulates synaptic strength and the formation or stability of GLR-1-containing synapses.},

Here, we characterized endolysosomes (late-endosomes and lysosomes) in aged neurons and the aged brain, which might drive synaptic decline since lysosomes are a cellular aging target and relevant for synapses. Neuronal aging induces enlarged endolysosome accumulation in the aged neurons and brain, especially distally, related to the increased anterograde movement. Aged lysosomes abound in neurites but are less degradative due to deacidification despite cathepsin D buildup, leading to late-endosome accumulation. Increasing the acidification of aged lysosomes by ML-SA1 treatment increased degradation and reverted synaptic decline, while lysosome alkalinization by chloroquine treatment mimicked age-dependent lysosome dysfunction and synaptic decline. We identify the deacidification of distal lysosomes as a neuronal mechanism of age-dependent synapse loss. Our findings suggest that future therapeutic strategies to address lysosomal defects might be able to delay age-related synaptic decline.

With incubation at 37 degrees C in such medium containing soluble tubulin, ribbons of protofilaments are formed on the surfaces of microtubules, with the ribbons curving in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. The direction of hooking reflects the polarity of the microtubule. In nerve pieces oriented such that cross sections could be viewed toward the perikarya of the axons, over 90\% of the ribbons on microtubules showed a clockwise orientation. When observers were looking toward the axonal terminals, most ribbons on microtubules showed a counterclockwise direction. In single axons in which ribbons appeared on all the contained microtubules, the ribbons showed a single directionality. The evidence suggests that microtubules in axons have a single polarity, probably reflecting their assembly from the perikarya outward through the axoplasm. If bidirectional transport is assumed in these axons, it is not reflected by the polarity of their microtubules, which may mean that the directionality of transport is provided by components other than microtubules.},

  abstract = {The polarization of neurons into axons and dendrites depends on extracellular cues, intracellular signaling, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and polarized transport, but the interplay between these processes during polarization remains unresolved. Here, we show that axon specification is determined by differences in microtubule network mobility between neurites, regulated by Rho guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) and extracellular cues. In developing neurons, retrograde microtubule flow prevents the entry of the axon-selective motor protein Kinesin-1 into most neurites. Using inducible assays to control microtubule network flow, we demonstrate that local inhibition of microtubule mobility is sufficient to guide Kinesin-1 into a specific neurite, whereas long-term global inhibition induces the formation of multiple axons. We furthermore show that extracellular mechanical cues and intracellular Rho GTPase signaling control the local differences in microtubule network flow. These results reveal a novel cytoskeletal mechanism for neuronal polarization.}

These motor proteins consist of N-terminal motor domain, followed by a neck region, three coiled-coil domains and a FHA domain, and a C-terminal PH domain. Between the coiled-coil 3 and the PH domain is a large uncharacterized region called stalk. In C. elegans unc-104 ( e1265 ), a partial loss of function mutant, synaptic vesicles are retained in the cell body and absent from presynaptic sites. unc-104 ( e1265 ) contains amino acid substitution D1497N in the PH domain and the mutant proteins show reduced PI(4,5)P(2) binding. Through genetic suppressor screening, we identified amino acid substitutions in a conserved region of the stalk that cause intragenic suppression of unc-104 ( e1265 ). Currently, little is known about the functions of the stalk region. Our findings imply potential compensatory or antagonistic interaction between the stalk region and the cargo binding PH domain.},

Our previous studies established that syntabulin is an adaptor capable of conjoining the kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B) motor and syntaxin-1. We now report that the complex of syntaxin-1\textendash syntabulin\textendash KIF5B mediates axonal transport of the active zone (AZ) components essential for presynaptic assembly. Syntabulin associates with AZ precursor carriers and colocalizes and comigrates with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Bassoon-labeled AZ transport cargos within developing axons. Knock-down of syntabulin or disruption of the syntaxin-1\textendash syntabulin\textendash KIF5B complex impairs the anterograde transport of GFP-Bassoon out of the soma and reduces the axonal densities of synaptic vesicle (SV) clusters and FM4-64 [N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4-(p-dibutylaminostyryl)pyridinium, dibromide] loading. Furthermore, syntabulin loss of function results in a reduction in both the amplitude of postsynaptic currents and the frequency of asynchronous quantal events, and abolishes the activity-induced recruitment of new GFP-Bassoon into the axons and subsequent coclustering with SVs. Consequently, syntabulin loss of function blocks the formation of new presynaptic boutons during activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in developing neurons. These studies establish that a kinesin motor\textendash adaptor complex is critical for the anterograde axonal transport of AZ components, thus contributing to activity-dependent presynaptic assembly during neuronal development.},

We showed previously that the Xenopus Kinesin-14 XCTK2 is regulated by Ran via the association of a bipartite NLS in the tail of XCTK2 with importin {$\alpha$}/{$\beta$}, which regulates its ability to cross-link microtubules during spindle formation. Here we show that mutation of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) of human Kinesin-14 HSET caused an accumulation of HSET in the cytoplasm, which resulted in strong microtubule bundling. HSET overexpression in HeLa cells resulted in longer spindles, similar to what was seen with NLS mutants of XCTK2 in extracts, suggesting that Kinesin-14 proteins play similar roles in extracts and in somatic cells. Conversely, HSET knockdown by RNAi resulted in shorter spindles but did not affect pole formation. The change in spindle length was not dependent on K-fibers, as elimination of the K-fiber by Nuf2 RNAi resulted in an increase in spindle length that was partially rescued by co-RNAi of HSET. However, these changes in spindle length did require microtubule sliding, as overexpression of an HSET mutant that had its sliding activity uncoupled from its ATPase activity resulted in cells with spindle lengths shorter than cells overexpressing wild-type HSET. Our results are consistent with a model in which Ran regulates the association of Kinesin-14s with importin {$\alpha$}/{$\beta$} to prevent aberrant cross-linking and bundling of microtubules by sequestering Kinesin-14s in the nucleus during interphase. Kinesin-14s act during mitosis to cross-link and slide between parallel microtubules to regulate spindle length.}

Inhibition of proteasome function blocks responses to netrin-1 and LPA but does not affect Sema3A responses. We further demonstrate in isolated growth cones that netrin-1 and Sema3A activate translation initiation factors and stimulate a marked rise in protein synthesis within minutes, while netrin-1 and LPA elicit similar rises in ubiquitin-protein conjugates. These results suggest that guidance molecules steer axon growth by triggering rapid local changes in protein levels in growth cones.},

Cytoplasmic dynein is responsible for transporting intracellular cargos in interphase cells and mediating spindle assembly and chromosome positioning during cell division. Other dynein isoforms transport cargos in cilia and power ciliary beating. Dyneins were the least studied of the cytoskeletal motors due to challenges in the reconstitution of active dynein complexes in vitro and the scarcity of high-resolution methods for in-depth structural and biophysical characterization of these motors. These challenges have been recently addressed, and there have been major advances in our understanding of the activation, mechanism, and regulation of dyneins. This review synthesizes the results of structural and biophysical studies for each class of dynein motors. We highlight several outstanding questions about the regulation of bidirectional transport along microtubules and the mechanisms that sustain self-coordinated oscillations within motile cilia.},

  abstract = {Neuronal dendrites are characterized by an anti-parallel microtubule organization. The mixed oriented microtubules promote dendrite development and facilitate polarized cargo trafficking; however, the mechanism that regulates dendritic microtubule organization is still unclear. Here, we found that the~kinesin-14 motor KIFC3 is important for organizing dendritic microtubules and to control dendrite development. The kinesin-14 motor proteins (Drosophila melanogaster Ncd, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Kar3, Saccharomyces pombe Pkl1, and Xenopus laevis XCTK2) are characterized by a C-terminal motor domain and are well described to organize the spindle microtubule during mitosis using an additional microtubule binding site in the N terminus [1-4]. In mammals, there are three kinesin-14 members, KIFC1, KIFC2, and KIFC3. It was recently shown that KIFC1 is important for organizing axonal microtubules in neurons, a process that depends on the two microtubule-interacting domains [5]. Unlike KIFC1, KIFC2 and KIFC3 lack the N-terminal microtubule binding domain and only have one microtubule-interacting domain, the motor domain [6, 7]. Thus, in order to regulate microtubule-microtubule crosslinking or sliding, KIFC2 and KIFC3 need to interact with additional microtubule binding proteins to connect two microtubules. We found that KIFC3 has a dendrite-specific distribution and interacts with microtubule minus-end binding protein CAMSAP2. Depletion of KIFC3 or CAMSAP2 results in increased microtubule dynamics during dendritic development. We propose a model in which CAMSAP2 anchors KIFC3 at microtubule minus ends and immobilizes microtubule arrays in dendrites.},

  abstract = {Classic pulse-chase studies have shown that actin is conveyed in slow axonal transport, but the mechanistic basis for this movement is unknown. Recently, we reported that axonal actin was surprisingly dynamic, with focal assembly/disassembly events (``actin hotspots'') and elongating polymers along the axon shaft (``actin trails''). Using a combination of live imaging, superresolution microscopy, and modeling, in this study, we explore how these dynamic structures can lead to processive transport of actin. We found relatively more actin trails elongated anterogradely as well as an overall slow, anterogradely biased flow of actin in axon shafts. Starting with first principles of monomer/filament assembly and incorporating imaging data, we generated a quantitative model simulating axonal hotspots and trails. Our simulations predict that the axonal actin dynamics indeed lead to a slow anterogradely biased flow of the population. Collectively, the data point to a surprising scenario where local assembly and biased polymerization generate the slow axonal transport of actin without involvement of microtubules (MTs) or MT-based motors. Mechanistically distinct from polymer sliding, this might be a general strategy to convey highly dynamic cytoskeletal cargoes.}

However, it is not known how the calcium-signaling complex, which consists of UNC-43/CaMKII, TIR-1/SARM adaptor protein and NSY-1/ASK1 MAPKKK, is localized to postsynaptic sites in the AWC axons for this lateral interaction. Here, we show that microtubule-based localization of the TIR-1 signaling complex to the synapses regulates AWC asymmetry. Similar to unc-43, tir-1 and nsy-1 loss-of-function mutants, specific disruption of microtubules in AWC by nocodazole generates two AWCON neurons. Reduced localization of UNC-43, TIR-1 and NSY-1 proteins in the AWC axons strongly correlates with the 2AWCON phenotype in nocodazole-treated animals. We identified kinesin motor unc-104/kif1a mutants for enhancement of the 2AWCON phenotype of a hypomorphic tir-1 mutant. Mutations in unc-104, like microtubule depolymerization, lead to a reduced level of UNC-43, TIR-1 and NSY-1 proteins in the AWC axons. In addition, dynamic transport of TIR-1 in the AWC axons is dependent on unc-104, the primary motor required for the transport of presynaptic vesicles. Furthermore, unc-104 acts non-cell autonomously in the AWCON neuron to regulate the AWCOFF identity. Together, these results suggest a model in which UNC-104 may transport some unknown presynaptic factor(s) in the future AWCON cell that non-cell autonomously control the trafficking of the TIR-1 signaling complex to postsynaptic regions of the AWC axons to regulate the AWCOFF identity.}

Interestingly, KIF1B{$\beta$} forms RNA\textendash protein complexes, containing the dendritically localized Arc and Calmodulin mRNAs, proteins previously shown to be part of RNA transport granules such as Pur{$\alpha$}, FMRP and FXR2P, and motor protein KIF3A, as well as Calmodulin. The interaction between KIF1B{$\beta$} and Calmodulin is Ca+2-dependent and takes place through a domain mapped at the carboxy-terminal tail of the motor. Live imaging of cortical neurons reveals active movement by KIF1B{$\beta$} at dendritic processes, suggesting that it mediates the transport of dendritically localized mRNAs. Finally, we show that synaptic recruitment of KIF1B{$\beta$} is activity-dependent and increased by stimulation of metabotropic or ionotropic glutamate receptors. The activity-dependent synaptic recruitment of KIF1B{$\beta$}, its interaction with Ca2+ sensor Calmodulin, and its new role as a dendritic motor of ribonucleoprotein complexes provide a novel basis for understanding the concerted co-ordination of motor protein mobilization and synaptic signaling pathways.},

The growing axons are represented as paths of interacting directed random walkers in two spatial dimensions. To mimic turnover of axons, whole paths are removed and new walkers are injected with specified rates. In the simplest version of the model, we use strongly adhesive short-range inter-axon interactions that are identical for all pairs of axons. We generalize the model to adhesive interactions of finite strengths and to multiple types of axons with type-specific interactions. The dynamic steady state is characterized by the position-dependent distribution of fascicle size and fascicle composition. With distance in the direction of axon growth, the mean fascicle size and emergent time scales grow monotonically, while the degree of sorting of fascicles by axon type has a maximum at a finite distance. To understand the emergence of slow time scales, we develop an analytical framework to analyze the interaction between neighboring fascicles.},

In addition to diffusible molecules1, this bidirectional flow of information could involve direct interactions through cell-adhesion molecules2,3. Here, we show that one class of cell-adhesion molecule, the integrins, are required for the functional maturation of hippocampal synapses in vitro. At immature synapses, a high probability of glutamate release (Pr) was correlated with the expression of postsynaptic NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors containing the NR2B subunit. The activity-dependent reduction in Pr and a switch in the subunit composition of synaptic NMDA receptors was prevented by chronic blockade with peptides containing the integrin-binding site Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD), or by a functional antibody against the {$\beta$}3 integrin subunit. Active synapses, monitored by the uptake of antibodies against the intraluminal domain of synaptotagmin I, also had {$\beta$}3 subunit immunoreactivity. Our results provide evidence that integrin-mediated signalling is essential for the orchestrated maturation of central excitatory synapses.},

We used a laser injury model in Caenorhabditis elegans mechanosensory neurons to screen 654 conserved genes for regulators of axonal regrowth. We uncover several functional clusters of genes that promote or repress regrowth, including genes classically known to affect axon guidance, membrane excitability, neurotransmission, and synaptic vesicle endocytosis. The conserved Arf Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF), EFA-6, acts as an intrinsic inhibitor of regrowth. By combining genetics and in~vivo imaging, we show that EFA-6 inhibits regrowth via microtubule dynamics, independent of its Arf GEF activity. Among newly identified regrowth inhibitors, only loss of function in EFA-6 partially bypasses the requirement for DLK-1 kinase.

In this paper, using genetic mouse model combined with live imaging, we demonstrate that syntaphilin (SNPH) mediates the activity-dependent immobilization of axonal mitochondria through binding to KIF5. In vitro analysis showed that the KIF5\textendash SNPH coupling inhibited the motor adenosine triphosphatase. Neuronal activity further recruited SNPH to axonal mitochondria. This motor-docking interplay was induced by Ca2+ and synaptic activity and was necessary to establish an appropriate balance between motile and stationary axonal mitochondria. Deleting snph abolished the activity-dependent immobilization of axonal mitochondria. We propose an ``Engine-Switch and Brake'' model, in which SNPH acts both as an engine off switch by sensing mitochondrial Rho guanosine triphosphatase-Ca2+ and as a brake by anchoring mitochondria to the microtubule track. Altogether, our study provides new mechanistic insight into the molecular interplay between motor and docking proteins, which arrests axonal mitochondrial transport in response to changes in neuronal activity.}

Here, we describe a type of axon-dendrite fasciculation in C.~elegans, where proximal dendrites of the nociceptor PVD adhere to the axon of the ALA interneuron. This axon-dendrite fasciculation is mediated by a previously uncharacterized adhesive signaling by the ALA membrane signal SAX-7/L1CAM and the PVD receptor SAX-3/Robo but independent of Slit. L1CAM physically interacts with Robo and instructs dendrite adhesion in a Robo-dependent manner. Fasciculation mediated by L1CAM-Robo signaling aligns F-actin dynamics in the dendrite growth cone and facilitates dynamic growth cone behaviors for efficient dendrite guidance. Disruption of PVD dendrite fasciculation impairs nociceptive mechanosensation and rhythmicity in body curvature, suggesting that dendrite fasciculation governs the functions of mechanosensory circuits. Our work elucidates the molecular mechanisms by which adhesive axon-dendrite signaling shapes the construction and function of sensory neuronal circuits.},

  abstract = {The transport of intracellular organelles is accomplished by groups of molecular motors, such as kinesin, myosin, and dynein. Previous studies have demonstrated that the cooperation between kinesins on a track is beneficial for long transport. However, within crowded three-dimensional (3D) cytoskeletal networks, surplus motors could impair transport and lead to traffic jams of cargos. Comprehensive understanding of the effects of the interactions among molecular motors, cargo, and tracks on the 3D cargo transport dynamics is still lack. In this work, a 3D stochastic multiphysics model is introduced to study the synergistic and antagonistic motions of kinesin motors walking on multiple mircotubules (MTs). Based on the model, we show that kinesins attaching to a common cargo can interact mechanically through the transient forces in their cargo linkers. Under different environmental conditions, such as different MT topologies and kinesin concentrations, the transient forces in the kinesins, the stepping frequency and the binding and unbinding probabilities of kinesins are changed substantially. Therefore, the macroscopic transport properties, specifically the stall force of the cargo, the transport direction at track intersections, and the mean-square displacement (MSD) of the cargo along the MT bundles vary over the environmental conditions. In general, conditions that improve the synergistic motion of kinesins increase the stall force of the cargo and the capability of maintaining the transport. In contrast, the antagonistic motion of kinesins temporarily traps the cargo and slows down the transport. Furthermore, this study predicts an optimal number of kinesins for the cargo transport at MT intersections and along MT bundles.}

Nav1.1 deficiency and mutations reduce interneuron excitability, a major pathological mechanism for epilepsy syndromes. However, the regulatory mechanisms of Nav1.1 expression remain unclear. Here, we provide evidence that neddylation is critical to Nav1.1 stability. Mutant mice lacking Nae1, an obligatory component of the E1 ligase for neddylation, in parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PVINs) exhibited spontaneous epileptic seizures and premature death. Electrophysiological studies indicate that Nae1 deletion reduced PVIN excitability and GABA release and consequently increased the network excitability of pyramidal neurons (PyNs). Further analysis revealed a reduction in sodium-current density, not a change in channel property, in mutant PVINs and decreased Nav1.1 protein levels. These results suggest that insufficient neddylation in PVINs reduces Nav1.1 stability and thus the excitability of PVINs; the ensuing increased PyN activity causes seizures in mice. Consistently, Nav1.1 was found reduced by proteomic analysis that revealed abnormality in synapses and metabolic pathways. Our findings describe a role of neddylation in maintaining Nav1.1 stability for PVIN excitability and reveal what we believe is a new mechanism in the pathogenesis of epilepsy.},

  abstract = {The correct wiring of neuronal circuits depends on outgrowth and guidance of neuronal processes during development. In the past two decades, great progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis of axon outgrowth and guidance. Genetic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans has played a key role in elucidating conserved pathways regulating axon guidance, including Netrin signaling, the slit Slit/Robo pathway, Wnt signaling, and others. Axon guidance factors were first identified by screens for mutations affecting animal behavior, and by direct visual screens for axon guidance defects. Genetic analysis of these pathways has revealed the complex and combinatorial nature of guidance cues, and has delineated how cues guide growth cones via receptor activity and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Several axon guidance pathways also affect directed migrations of non-neuronal cells in C. elegans, with implications for normal and pathological cell migrations in situations such as tumor metastasis. The small number of neurons and highly stereotyped axonal architecture of the C. elegans nervous system allow analysis of axon guidance at the level of single identified axons, and permit in vivo tests of prevailing models of axon guidance. C. elegans axons also have a robust capacity to undergo regenerative regrowth after precise laser injury (axotomy). Although such axon regrowth shares some similarities with developmental axon outgrowth, screens for regrowth mutants have revealed regeneration-specific pathways and factors that were not identified in developmental screens. Several areas remain poorly understood, including how major axon tracts are formed in the embryo, and the function of axon regeneration in the natural environment.}

We describe here a procedure for the purification of this enzyme by its binding to ubiquitin-Sepharose. Binding of the enzyme to the affinity column requires ATP and Mg2+, and bound enzyme cannot be displaced by high salt but can be eluted by raising the pH, by increased concentrations of a thiol compound, or by the joint supplementation of AMP and pyrophosphate. Another form of the enzyme that cannot carry out AMP-ATP exchange (but catalyzes ubiquitin-dependent PPi-ATP exchange) does not bind to the affinity column. These data indicate that a covalent, possibly thiolester intermediate, is formed between the activating enzyme and Sepharose-bound ubiquitin. It is suggested designating this procedure of enzyme isolation "covalent affinity" chromatography. The purified enzyme has an apparent Mr = 210,000 and appears to be composed of two subunits of Mr = 105, 000. ATP-dependent binding of ubiquitin to the purified enzyme and to its subunit is demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Specific recognition of cellular cargo and efficient transport to its correct intracellular destination is an infrastructural challenge faced by most eukaryotic cells. This remarkable deed is accomplished by processive motor proteins that are subject to robust regulatory mechanisms. The first level of regulation entails the ability of the motor to suppress its own activity. This autoinhibition is eventually relieved by specific cargo binding. To better understand the role of the cargo during motor activation, we dissected the activation mechanism of the ciliary homodimeric kinesin-2 from Caenorhabditis elegans by its physiological cargo. In functional reconstitution assays, we identified two cargo adaptor proteins that together are necessary and sufficient to allosterically activate the autoinhibited motor. Surprisingly, the orthologous adaptor proteins from the unicellular green algae Chlamydomonas~reinhardtii also fully activated the kinesin-2 from worm, even though C. reinhardtii itself lacks a homodimeric kinesin-2 motor. The latter suggested that a motor activation mechanism similar to the C. elegans model existed already well before metazoans evolved, and prompted us to scrutinize predicted homodimeric kinesin-2 orthologs in other evolutionarily distant eukaryotes. We show that the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila not only possesses a homodimeric kinesin-2 but that it also shares the same allosteric activation mechanism that we delineated in the C. elegans model. Our results point to a much more fundamental role of homodimeric kinesin-2 in intraflagellar transport (IFT) than previously thought and warrant further scrutiny of distantly related organisms toward a comprehensive picture of the IFT process and its evolution.}

  abstract = {Kinesin-2 enables ciliary assembly and maintenance as an anterograde intraflagellar transport (IFT) motor. Molecular motor activity is driven by a heterotrimeric complex comprised of KIF3A and KIF3B or KIF3C plus one non-motor subunit, KIFAP3. Using exome sequencing, we identified heterozygous KIF3B variants in two unrelated families with hallmark ciliopathy phenotypes. In the first family, the proband presents with hepatic fibrosis, retinitis pigmentosa, and postaxial polydactyly; he harbors a de novo c.748G{$>$}C (p.Glu250Gln) variant affecting the kinesin motor domain encoded by KIF3B. The second family is a six-generation pedigree affected predominantly by retinitis pigmentosa. Affected individuals carry a heterozygous c.1568T{$>$}C (p.Leu523Pro) KIF3B variant segregating in an autosomal-dominant pattern. We observed a significant increase in primary cilia length in~vitro in the context of either of the two mutations while variant KIF3B proteins retained stability indistinguishable from wild type. Furthermore, we tested the effects of KIF3B mutant mRNA expression in the developing zebrafish retina. In the presence of either missense variant, rhodopsin was sequestered to the photoreceptor rod inner segment layer with a concomitant increase in photoreceptor cilia length. Notably, impaired rhodopsin trafficking is also characteristic of recessive KIF3B models as exemplified by an early-onset, autosomal-recessive, progressive retinal degeneration in Bengal cats; we identified a c.1000G{$>$}A (p.Ala334Thr) KIF3B variant by genome-wide association study and whole-genome sequencing. Together, our genetic, cell-based, and in~vivo modeling data delineate an autosomal-dominant syndromic retinal ciliopathy in humans and suggest that multiple KIF3B pathomechanisms can impair kinesin-driven ciliary transport in the photoreceptor.},

  abstract = {Chemical synapses contain multitudes of proteins, which in common with all proteins, have finite lifetimes and therefore need to be continuously replaced. Given the huge numbers of synaptic connections typical neurons form, the demand to maintain the protein contents of these connections might be expected to place considerable metabolic demands on each neuron. Moreover, synaptic proteostasis might differ according to distance from global protein synthesis sites, the availability of distributed protein synthesis facilities, trafficking rates and synaptic protein dynamics. To date, the turnover kinetics of synaptic proteins have not been studied or analyzed systematically, and thus metabolic demands or the aforementioned relationships remain largely unknown. In the current study we used dynamic Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC), mass spectrometry (MS), Fluorescent Non\textendash Canonical Amino acid Tagging (FUNCAT), quantitative immunohistochemistry and bioinformatics to systematically measure the metabolic half-lives of hundreds of synaptic proteins, examine how these depend on their pre/postsynaptic affiliation or their association with particular molecular complexes, and assess the metabolic load of synaptic proteostasis. We found that nearly all synaptic proteins identified here exhibited half-lifetimes in the range of 2\textendash 5 days. Unexpectedly, metabolic turnover rates were not significantly different for presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins, or for proteins for which mRNAs are consistently found in dendrites. Some functionally or structurally related proteins exhibited very similar turnover rates, indicating that their biogenesis and degradation might be coupled, a possibility further supported by bioinformatics-based analyses. The relatively low turnover rates measured here ({$\sim$}0.7\% of synaptic protein content per hour) are in good agreement with imaging-based studies of synaptic protein trafficking, yet indicate that the metabolic load synaptic protein turnover places on individual neurons is very substantial.},

To this end we have raised antisera to peptides corresponding to highly conserved regions of the motor domains of several known members of the kinesin superfamily. These peptide antibodies react specifically with the motor domains of kinesin and ncd protein, as expected, and they also react with several polypeptides (including kinesin heavy chain) that cosediment with microtubules (MTs) precipitated from AMPPNP-treated sea urchin egg cytosol. Subsequent fractionation of ATP eluates of these MTs yields a protein of relative molecular mass 330 x 10(3) that behaves as a complex of three polypeptides that are distinct from conventional kinesin subunits or fragments thereof. This complex contains 85 kDa and 95 kDa polypeptides, which react with our peptide antibodies, and a 115 kDa polypeptide, which does not. This triplet of polypeptides, which we refer to as KRP(85/95), binds to purified sea urchin egg tubulin in an AMPPNP-enhanced, ATP-sensitive manner and induces the formation of microtubule bundles. We therefore propose that the triplet corresponds to a novel sea urchin egg kinesin-related protein.},

When IFT is inhibited by inactivation of a kinesin, FLA10, in the temperature-sensitive mutant, fla10, existing flagella resorb and new flagella cannot be assembled. We report here that: (a) the IFT-associated FLA10 protein is a subunit of a heterotrimeric kinesin; (b) IFT particles are composed of 15 polypeptides comprising two large complexes; (c) the FLA10 kinesin-II and IFT particle polypeptides, in addition to being found in flagella, are highly concentrated around the flagellar basal bodies; and, (d) mutations affecting homologs of two of the IFT particle polypeptides in Caenorhabditis elegans result in defects in the sensory cilia located on the dendritic processes of sensory neurons. In the accompanying report by Pazour, G.J., C.G. Wilkerson, and G.B. Witman (1998. J.

One class of these molecular motors, kinesin-II, is unique in that these proteins are typically found as heterotrimeric complexes containing two different, though related, kinesin-like motor subunits, and a single nonmotor subunit. The heteromeric nature of these kinesins appears to have resulted in a class of combinatorial kinesins which can `mix and match' different motor subunits. Another novel feature of these motors is that the activities of several kinesin-II representatives are essential in the assembly of motile and nonmotile cilia, a role not attributed to any other kinesin. This review presents a brief overview of the structure and biological functions of kinesin-II, the heteromeric kinesin.},

In contrast to the cell body localization of wild type motor, the mutant motors accumulate on neuronal processes. Once on the neuronal process, the mutant motors display dynamic movement similarly to wild type motors. The gain-of-function mutation on the motor domain leads to an active dimeric conformation, releasing the inhibitory CC1 region from the motor domain. Genetically engineered mutations in the motor domain or CC1 of UNC-104, which disrupt the autoinhibitory interface, also led to the gain of function and hyperactivation of axonal transport. Thus, the CC1/motor domain-mediated autoinhibition is crucial for UNC-104/KIF1A-mediated axonal transport in vivo.},

Whilst the action of ivermectin on the pharyngeal muscle of nematodes is relatively well understood, its effect on locomotor activity is less clear. Here we use RNAi and gene knockouts to show that four GluCl{$\alpha$} subunits are involved in regulating the pattern of locomotor activity in Caenorhabditis elegans. A Haemonchus contortus orthologue of these subunits, HcGluCl{$\alpha$}3, has been shown to be expressed in the motor nervous system and here we have shown that it is a functional, as well as a structural, orthologue by virtue of the observation that it can restore normal motor movement in the C. elegans GluCl{$\alpha$} mutant, avr-14(ad1032), when expressed under the control of the avr-14 promoter. This supports the contention that ivermectin exerts its paralytic action on parasitic nematodes through activation of GluCl channels in the motor nervous system. Furthermore, functional complementation in C. elegans provides a method to further the understanding of this important class of anthelmintic targets.},

Inputs from sex-specific circuitry to central circuitry reveal points at which sexual and non-sexual pathways converge. In sex-shared central pathways, a substantial number of connections differ in strength between the sexes.~Quantitative connectomes that include~all connections serve~as the basis for understanding how complex, adaptive behavior is generated.},

  abstract = {Chromosome segregation during mitosis is highly regulated to ensure production of genetically identical progeny. Recurrent mitotic errors cause chromosomal instability (CIN), a hallmark of tumors. The E6 and E7 oncoproteins of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes cervical, anal, and head and neck cancers (HNC), cause mitotic defects consistent with CIN in models of anogenital cancers, but this has not been studied in the context of HNC. Here, we show that HPV16 induces a specific type of CIN in patient HNC tumors, patient-derived xenografts, and cell lines, which is due to defects in chromosome congression. These defects are specifically induced by the HPV16 oncogene E6 rather than E7. We show that HPV16 E6 expression causes degradation of the mitotic kinesin CENP-E, whose depletion produces chromosomes that are chronically misaligned near spindle poles (polar chromosomes) and fail to congress. Though the canonical oncogenic role of E6 is the degradation of the tumor suppressor p53, CENP-E degradation and polar chromosomes occur independently of p53. Instead, E6 directs CENP-E degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner via the E6-associated ubiquitin protein ligase E6AP/UBE3A. This study reveals a mechanism by which HPV induces CIN, which may impact HPV-mediated tumor initiation, progression, and therapeutic response.},

Finally, using single dendrite transfection, it was shown that local protein synthesis occurs in dendrites and growth cones.

  abstract = {Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), is a phylogenetically ancient molecule best characterized as a neurotransmitter that modulates multiple aspects of mood and social cognition. The roles that 5-HT plays in normal and abnormal behavior are not fully understood but have been posited to be due to its common function as a `defense signal'. However, 5-HT levels also systemically impact cell physiology, modulating cell division, migration, apoptosis, mitochondrial biogenesis, cellular metabolism and differentiation. Whether these diverse cellular effects of 5-HT also share a common basis is unclear. C. elegans provides an ideal system to interrogate the systemic effects of 5-HT, since lacking a blood-brain barrier, 5-HT synthesized and released by neurons permeates the organism to modulate neuronal as well as non-neuronal cells throughout the body. Here we used RNA-Seq to characterize the systemic changes in gene expression that occur in C. elegans upon altering 5-HT levels, and compared the transcriptomes to published datasets. We find that an acute increase in 5-HT is accompanied by a global decrease in gene expression levels, upregulation of genes involved in stress pathways, changes that significantly correlate with the published transcriptomes of animals that have activated defense and immune responses, and an increase in levels of phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor, eIF2{$\alpha$}. In 5-HT deficient animals lacking tryptophan hydroxylase (tph-1 ~(mg280) II) there is a net increase in gene expression, with an overrepresentation of genes related to development and chromatin. Surprisingly, the transcriptomes of animals with acute increases in 5-HT levels, and 5-HT deficiency do not overlap with transcriptomes of mutants with whom they share striking physiological resemblance. These studies are the first to catalog systemic transcriptome changes that occur upon alterations in 5-HT levels. They further show that in C. elegans changes in gene expression upon altering 5-HT levels, and changes in physiology, are not directly correlated.}

It was found that a large amount of the NA in thc nerve betwcen the two ligations was transported down to the part just above the low ligation. By both method:; it was shown that during the first hours after the ligation the course of accumulation of NA in the nerve just proximal to the low ligation was about the same as the accumulation curve for the nerve (connected to the cell bodies) above the high ligature. Thereafter no further changes were found to occur in the nerve between the constrictions, whereas in the part above the high ligature the accumulation of NA continued as described earlier. The total NA content in the nerve between the two ligatures did not exceed the amount of a normal nerve of the same length. It was concluded that the transport mechanism in the adrenergic fibres is mainly independent of the cell hody (and the nerve terminals) and that no increase in the NA content in the axons occurs after a ligation of the nerve. Furthermore, the present study gives support to the earlier obtained data for the transport of amine granules in the sciatic nerve of rat and cat.},

EphB-mediated signalling seems to be particularly significant for a subset of synaptic inputs in vivo.A number of molecules belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins (synaptic cell adhesion molecule (SynCAM), synaptic adhesion-like molecule (SALM) and netrin G2 ligand (NGL2)) also contain intracellular PDZ binding domains that permit interactions with the postsynaptic scaffold protein PSD-95 (postsynaptic density protein-95). Each of these trans-synaptic signals can control aspects of excitatory synapse formation in vitro.Cadherins signal via catenins to regulate dendritic spine morphology and motility. In addition, in vivo work has shown that the loss of particular catenin molecules results in abnormal synapse formation and/or maturation.Ephs and ephrins regulate two mechanistically distinct forms of long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. At the mossy fibre\textendash CA3 synapse this occurs downstream of a transynaptic interaction between postsynaptic EphB and presynaptic ephrin-B, whereas at the Schaeffer collateral\textendash CA1 synapse the mechanism is less clear.Multiple lines of evidence indicate that neural cell adhesion molecule and cadherin regulate hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Both molecules possess multiple adhesive and signalling functions that could be important for plasticity, but the exact mechanisms by which these molecules regulate these functions are not clear.},

Previous studies have revealed that polyribosomes are selectively positioned beneath postsynaptic sites1,2 suggesting that in neurons, as in other cell types3\textendash 8,19, protein synthetic machinery is located at or near the sites where particular proteins are needed. The mechanisms that deliver ribosomes and messenger RNA to their specific destinations in cells are therefore of considerable interest. Here we describe a system for RNA transport in dendrites that could provide a mechanism for the delivery of ribosomes and mRNA to synaptic sites in dendrites. Hippocampal neurons grown in culture incorporate 3H-uridine in the nucleus, then selectively transport the newly synthesized RNA into dendrites at a rate of about 0.5 mm day\textendash 1. The transport is inhibited by metabolic poisons, suggesting that it is an active, energy-dependent process. The RNA may be transported in association with the cytoskeleton.},

  abstract = {Kinesin is a mechanochemical enzyme composed of three distinct domains: a globular head domain, a rodlike stalk domain, and a small globular tail domain. The stalk domain has sequence features characteristic of alpha-helical coiled coils. To gain insight into the structure of the kinesin stalk, we expressed it from a segment of the Drosophila melanogaster kinesin heavy chain gene and purified it from Escherichia coli. When observed by EM, this protein formed a rodlike structure 40-55 nm long that was occasionally bent at a hingelike region near the middle of the molecule. An additional EM study and a chemical cross-linking study showed that this protein forms a parallel dimer and that the two chains are in register. Finally, using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we showed that this protein is approximately 55-60\% alpha-helical in physiological aqueous solution at 25 degrees C, and approximately 85-90\% alpha-helical at 4 degrees C. From these results, we conclude that the stalk of kinesin heavy chain forms an alpha-helical coiled coil structure. The temperature dependence of the circular dichroism signal has two major transitions, at 25-30 degrees C and at 45-50 degrees C, which suggests that a portion of the alpha-helical structure in the stalk is less stable than the rest. By producing the amino-terminal (coil 1) and carboxy-terminal (coil 2) halves of the stalk separately in E. coli, we showed that the region that melts below 30 degrees C lies within coil 1, while the majority of coil 2 melts above 45 degrees C. We suggest that this difference in stability may play a role in the force-generating mechanism or regulation of kinesin.}

How semaphorins are transported and secreted by neurons is poorly understood. We find that endogenous semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) displays a punctate distribution in axons and dendrites of cultured cortical neurons. GFP\textendash Sema3A shows a similar distribution and co-localizes with secretory vesicle cargo proteins. Live-cell imaging reveals highly dynamic trafficking of GFP\textendash Sema3A vesicles with distinct properties in axons and dendrites regarding directionality, velocity, mobility and pausing time. In axons, most GFP\textendash Sema3A vesicles move fast without interruption, almost exclusively in the anterograde direction, while in dendrites many GFP\textendash Sema3A vesicles are stationary and move equally frequent in both directions. Disruption of microtubules, but not of actin filaments, significantly impairs GFP\textendash Sema3A transport. Interestingly, depolarization induces a reversible arrest of axonal transport of GFP\textendash Sema3A vesicles but has little effect on dendritic transport. Conversely, action potential blockade using tetrodotoxin (TTX) accelerates axonal transport, but not dendritic transport. These data indicate that axons and dendrites regulate trafficking of Sema3A and probably other secretory vesicles in distinct ways, with axons specializing in fast, uninterrupted, anterograde transport. Furthermore, neuronal activity regulates secretory vesicle trafficking in axons by a depolarization-evoked trafficking arrest.},

The heads remained widely separated, and their stepping behavior varied as a function of interhead separation. One active head was sufficient for processive movement, and an active head could drag an inactive partner head forward. Thus, dynein moves processively without interhead coordination, a mechanism fundamentally distinct from the hand-over-hand stepping of kinesin and myosin.}

Choline Acetyltransferase (ChAT), a soluble protein that synthesizes acetylcholine at the presynaptic compartment, is transported in bulk in the axons by the heterotrimeric Kinesin-2 motor. Axonal transport of soluble proteins is described as a constitutive process assisted by occasional, non-specific interactions with moving vesicles and motor proteins. Here, we report that an increase in the influx of Kinesin-2 motor and association between ChAT and the motor during a specific developmental period enhances the axonal entry, as well as the anterograde flow of the protein, in the sensory neurons of intact Drosophila nervous system. Loss of cholinergic activity due to ~Hemicholinium and Bungarotoxin treatments, respectively, disrupts the interaction between ChAT and Kinesin-2 in the axon, and the episodic enhancement of axonal influx of the protein. Altogether, these observations highlight a phenomenon of synaptic activity-dependent, feedback regulation of a soluble protein transport in vivo, which could potentially define the quantum of its pre-synaptic influx.},

Here we show that ubiquitin-dependent mechanisms regulate synaptic development at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Neuronal overexpression of the deubiquitinating protease fat facets4 leads to a profound disruption of synaptic growth control; there is a large increase in the number of synaptic boutons, an elaboration of the synaptic branching pattern, and a disruption of synaptic function. Antagonizing the ubiquitination pathway in neurons by expression of the yeast deubiquitinating protease UBP2 (ref. 5) also produces synaptic overgrowth and dysfunction. Genetic interactions between fat facets and highwire6, a negative regulator of synaptic growth that has structural homology to a family of ubiquitin ligases, suggest that synaptic development may be controlled by the balance between positive and negative regulators of ubiquitination.},

The possibility to deliver very low average power to the sample reduced the collateral thermal damage and allowed studying axonal regeneration of mouse neurons during early days in vitro. Force spectroscopy measurements were performed during and after axon ablation with a bead attached to the axonal membrane and held in an optical trap. With this approach, we quantified the adhesion of the axon to the substrate and the viscoelastic properties of the membrane during regeneration. The reorganization and regeneration of the axon was documented by long-term live imaging. Here we demonstrate that BDNF regulates neuronal adhesion and favors the formation of actin waves during regeneration after axonal lesion.},

  abstract = {Neurons are highly polarized cells that consist of three main structural and functional domains: a cell body or soma, an axon, and dendrites. These domains contain smaller compartments with essential roles for proper neuronal function, such as the axonal presynaptic boutons and the dendritic postsynaptic spines. The structure and function of these compartments have now been characterized in great detail. Intriguingly, however, in the last decade additional levels of compartmentalization within the axon and the dendrites have been identified, revealing that these structures are much more complex than previously thought. Herein we examine several types of structural and functional sub-compartmentalization found in neurons of both vertebrates and invertebrates. For example, in mammalian neurons the axonal initial segment functions as a sub-compartment to initiate the action potential, to select molecules passing into the axon, and to maintain neuronal polarization. Moreover, work in Drosophila melanogaster has shown that two distinct axonal guidance receptors are precisely clustered in adjacent segments of the commissural axons both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting a cell-intrinsic mechanism underlying the compartmentalized receptor localization. In Caenorhabditis elegans, a subset of interneurons exhibits calcium dynamics that are localized to specific sections of the axon and control the gait of navigation, demonstrating a regulatory role of compartmentalized neuronal activity in behaviour. These findings have led to a number of new questions, which are important for our understanding of neuronal development and function. How are these sub-compartments established and maintained? What molecular machinery and cellular events are involved? What is their functional significance for the neuron? Here, we reflect on these and other key questions that remain to be addressed in this expanding field of biology.},

Elevation of glucose leads to increases in cytosolic [Ca\textsuperscript{2+}] \textsubscript{i} and biphasic release of insulin from both a readily releasable and a storage pool of {$\beta$}-granules. The effect of elevated [Ca\textsuperscript{2+}] \textsubscript{i} on phosphorylation of isolated {$\beta$}-granule membrane proteins was evaluated, and the phosphorylation of four proteins was found to be altered by [Ca\textsuperscript{2+}] \textsubscript{i} . One (a 18/20-kDa doublet) was a Ca\textsuperscript{2+}-dependent increase in phosphorylation, and, surprisingly, three others (138, 42, and 36 kDa) were Ca\textsuperscript{2+}-dependent dephosphorylations. The 138-kDa {$\beta$}-granule phosphoprotein was found to be kinesin heavy chain (KHC). At low levels of [Ca\textsuperscript{2+}] \textsubscript{i} KHC was phosphorylated by casein kinase 2, but KHC was rapidly dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 2B {$\beta$} (PP2B{$\beta$}) as [Ca\textsuperscript{2+}] \textsubscript{i} increased. Inhibitors of PP2B specifically reduced the second, microtubule-dependent, phase of insulin secretion, suggesting that dephosphorylation of KHC was required for transport of {$\beta$}-granules from the storage pool to replenish the readily releasable pool of {$\beta$}-granules. This is distinct from synaptic vesicle exocytosis, because neurotransmitter release from synaptosomes did not require a Ca\textsuperscript{2+}-dependent KHC dephosphorylation. These results suggest a novel mechanism for regulating KHC function and {$\beta$}-granule transport in {$\beta$}-cells that is mediated by casein kinase 2 and PP2B. They also implicate a novel regulatory role for PP2B/calcineurin in the control of insulin secretion downstream of a rise in [Ca\textsuperscript{2+}] \textsubscript{i} .{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In contrast to synaptic proteins, membrane proteins were relatively shorter-lived and mitochondrial proteins were longer-lived compared to the population. Half-lives also correlate with protein functions and the dynamics of the complexes they are incorporated in. Proteins in glia possessed shorter half-lives than the same proteins in neurons. The presence of glia sped up or slowed down the turnover of neuronal proteins.

The VSV glycoprotein appeared in clusters on the dendritic surface, while the hemagglutinin was distributed uniformly along the axonal membrane.

  abstract = {The Fur4p uracil permease, like most yeast plasma membrane proteins, undergoes ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis and is then targeted to the vacuole (equivalent to the mammalian lysosome) for degradation. The cell surface ubiquitination of Fur4p is mediated by the essential Rsp5p ubiquitin ligase. Ubiquitination of Fur4p occurs on two target lysines, which receive two ubiquitin moieties linked through ubiquitin Lys63, a type of linkage (termed UbK63) different from that involved in proteasome recognition. We report that pep4 cells deficient for vacuolar protease activities accumulate vacuolar unubiquitinated Fur4p. In contrast, pep4 cells lacking the Doa4p ubiquitin isopeptidase accumulate ubiquitin-conjugated Fur4p. These data suggest that Fur4p undergoes Doa4p-dependent deubiquitination prior to vacuolar degradation. Compared to pep4 cells, pep4 doa4 cells have huge amounts of membrane-bound ubiquitin conjugates. This indicates that Doa4p plays a general role in the deubiquitination of membrane-bound proteins, as suggested by reports describing the suppression of some doa4 phenotypes in endocytosis and vacuolar protein sorting mutants. Some of the small ubiquitin-linked peptides that are a hallmark of Doa4 deficiency are not present in rsp5 mutant cells or after overproduction of a variant ubiquitin modified at Lys 63 (UbK63R). These data suggest that the corresponding peptides are degradation products of Rsp5p substrates and probably of ubiquitin conjugates carrying UbK63 linkages. Doa4p thus appears to be involved in the deubiquitination of endocytosed plasma membrane proteins, some of them carrying UbK63 linkages.},

It is linked to at least 30 loci, among them SPG10, which causes dominant forms and originates in point mutations in the neuronal Kinesin-1 gene (KIF5A). Here, we investigate the motility of KIF5A and four HSP mutants. All mutations are single amino-acid exchanges and located in kinesin's motor or neck domain. The mutation in the neck (A361V) did not change the gliding properties in vitro, the others either reduced microtubule affinity or gliding velocity or both. In laser-trapping assays, none of the mutants moved more than a few steps along microtubules. Motility assays with mixtures of homodimeric wild-type, homodimeric mutant and heterodimeric wild-type/mutant motors revealed that only one mutant (N256S) reduces the gliding velocity at ratios present in heterozygous patients, whereas the others (K253N, R280C) do not. Attached to quantum dots as artificial cargo, mixtures involving N256S mutants produced slower cargo populations lagging behind in transport, whereas mixtures with the other mutants led to populations of quantum dots that rarely bound to microtubules. These differences indicate that the dominant inheritance of SPG10 is caused by two different mechanisms that both reduce the gross cargo flux, leading to deficient supply of the synapse.}

Light stimulates DNA repair and metabolism changes in bacteria, avoidance responses in single-cell organisms, attraction responses in plants, and both visual and nonvisual perception in animals. Despite these widely differing responses, in all of nature there are only six known families of proteins that can transduce light. Although the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans has none of the known light transduction systems, we show here that C. elegans strongly accelerates its locomotion in response to blue or shorter wavelengths of light, with maximal responsiveness to ultraviolet light. Our data suggest that C. elegans uses this light response to escape the lethal doses of sunlight that permeate its habitat. Short-wavelength light drives locomotion by bypassing two critical signals, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and diacylglycerol (DAG), that neurons use to shape and control behaviors. C. elegans mutants lacking these signals are paralyzed and unresponsive to harsh physical stimuli in ambient light, but short-wavelength light rapidly rescues their paralysis and restores normal levels of coordinated locomotion. This light response is mediated by LITE-1, a novel ultraviolet light receptor that acts in neurons and is a member of the invertebrate Gustatory receptor (Gr) family. Heterologous expression of the receptor in muscle cells is sufficient to confer light responsiveness on cells that are normally unresponsive to light. Our results reveal a novel molecular solution for ultraviolet light detection and an unusual sensory modality in C. elegans that is unlike any previously described light response in any organism.},

  abstract = {Axons in the CNS do not regrow after injury, whereas lesioned axons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) regenerate. Lesioned CNS axons form characteristic swellings at their tips known as retraction bulbs, which are the nongrowing counterparts of growth cones. Although much progress has been made in identifying intracellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate growth cone locomotion and axonal elongation, a comprehensive understanding of how retraction bulbs form and why they are unable to grow is still elusive. Here we report the analysis of the morphological and intracellular responses of injured axons in the CNS compared with those in the PNS. We show that retraction bulbs of injured CNS axons increase in size over time, whereas growth cones of injured PNS axons remain constant. Retraction bulbs contain a disorganized microtubule network, whereas growth cones possess the typical bundling of microtubules. Using in vivo imaging, we find that pharmacological disruption of microtubules in growth cones transforms them into retraction bulb-like structures whose growth is inhibited. Correspondingly, microtubule destabilization of sensory neurons in cell culture induces retraction bulb formation. Conversely, microtubule stabilization prevents the formation of retraction bulbs and decreases axonal degeneration in vivo. Finally, microtubule stabilization enhances the growth capacity of CNS neurons cultured on myelin. Thus, the stability and organization of microtubules define the fate of lesioned axonal stumps to become either advancing growth cones or nongrowing retraction bulbs. Our data pinpoint microtubules as a key regulatory target for axonal regeneration.},

  abstract = {Objective To determine the cause and course of a novel syndrome with progressive encephalopathy and brain atrophy in children. Methods Clinical whole-exome sequencing was performed for global developmental delay and intellectual disability; some patients also had spastic paraparesis and evidence of clinical regression. Six patients were identified with de novo missense mutations in the kinesin gene KIF1A. The predicted functional disruption of these mutations was assessed in silico to compare the calculated conformational flexibility and estimated efficiency of ATP binding to kinesin motor domains of wild-type (WT) versus mutant alleles. Additionally, an in vitro microtubule gliding assay was performed to assess the effects of de novo dominant, inherited recessive, and polymorphic variants on KIF1A motor function. Results All six subjects had severe developmental delay, hypotonia, and varying degrees of hyperreflexia and spastic paraparesis. Microcephaly, cortical visual impairment, optic neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, epilepsy, and movement disorders were also observed. All six patients had a degenerative neurologic course with progressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophy seen on sequential magnetic resonance imaging scans. Computational modeling of mutant protein structures when compared to WT kinesin showed substantial differences in conformational flexibility and ATP-binding efficiency. The de novo KIF1A mutants were nonmotile in the microtubule gliding assay. Interpretation De novo mutations in KIF1A cause a degenerative neurologic syndrome with brain atrophy. Computational and in vitro assays differentiate the severity of dominant de novo heterozygous versus inherited recessive KIF1A mutations. The profound effect de novo mutations have on axonal transport is likely related to the cause of progressive neurologic impairment in these patients.},

Here, we present a study of the regulation of Cenp-E motility by using purified full-length (FL) Xenopus Cenp-E protein, which demonstrates that FL Cenp-E is a genuine plus-end-directed motor. Furthermore, we find that the Cenp-E tail completely blocks the motility of Cenp-E in vitro. This is achieved through direct interaction between its motor and tail domains. Finally, we show that Cenp-E autoinhibition is reversed by MPS1- or CDK1-cyclin B-mediated phosphorylation of the Cenp-E tail. This suggests a model of dynamic control of Cenp-E motility, and hence chromosome congression, dependent upon phosphorylation at the kinetochore.},

When isolated rabbit reticulocytes incorporate the valine analog 2-amino-3chlorobutyric acid (ClAbu) in place of valine, they produce an abnormal globin that is degraded with a half-life of 15 min. Normal hemoglobin, in contrast, undergoes little or no breakdown within these cells. Cell-free extracts from reticulocytes have been shown to rapidly hydrolyze these abnormal proteins. The degradative system is located in the 100,000 X g supernatant, has a pH optimum of 7.8, and does not appear to be of lysosomal origin. This breakdown of analog-containing protein was stimulated severalfold by ATP, and slightly by ADP. AMP and adenosine-3':5'-cyclic monophosphate had no significant effect on proteolysis. Experiments with ATP analogs suggest that the terminal high energy phosphate is important in the degradative process. Proteolysis in the cell-free system and in intact reticulocytes was inhibited by the same agents (L-l-tosylamido-2-phenyl-ethylchloromethyl ketone, N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, N-ethylmaleimide, iodoacetamide, and o-phenanthroline). In addition, the relative rates of degradation of several polypeptides in the cell-free extracts paralleled degradatives rates within cells. Thus, a soluble nonlysosomal proteolytic system appears responsible for the energy-dependent degradation of abnormal proteins in reticulocytes.}

  abstract = {Axonal transport is essential for neuronal survival. This is driven by microtubule motors including dynein, which transports cargo from the axon tip back to the cell body. This function requires its co-factor dynactin and regulators LIS1 and NDEL1. Due to difficulties imaging dynein at a single-molecule level, it is unclear how this motor and its regulators coordinate transport along the length of the axon. Here we use neuron-inducible human stem-cell-lines (NGN2-OPTi-OX) to endogenously tag dynein components and visualise them at a near-single molecule regime. In the retrograde direction, we find that dynein and dynactin can move the entire length of the axon ({$>$}500 um) in one go. Furthermore, LIS1 and NDEL1 also undergo long-distance movement, despite being mainly implicated with initiation of dynein transport. Intriguingly, in the anterograde direction, dynein/LIS1 move faster than dynactin/NDEL1 consistent with transport on different cargos. Therefore, neurons ensure efficient transport by holding dynein/dynactin on cargos over long distances, but keeping them separate until required.},

In a widely used mouse model of motoneuron disease (progressive motor neuronopathy or pmn) [2-4], transgenic expression of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 gene [5] or treatment with glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor [6] prevents the apoptosis of the motoneuron soma; however, they were unable to affect the life span of the animals. The goal of the present work was to determine whether the pmn phenotype could be rescued by means of a gene that inhibits axon degeneration. For this reason, the pmn mice were crossed with mice bearing the dominant Wlds ("slow Wallerian degeneration") mutation, which slows axon degeneration and synapse loss [7-9]. We show here that the Wlds gene product attenuates symptoms, extends life span, prevents axon degeneration, rescues motoneuron number and size, and delays retrograde transport deficits in pmn/pmn mice. These results suggest new pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic avenues for motoneuron diseases.},

Kinesin-14, one of the motors involved, causes spindle collapse in the absence of kinesin-5 (Refs 2, 3), participates in spindle assembly and modulates spindle length. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these activities are not known. Here, we report that Drosophila melanogaster kinesin-14 (Ncd) alone causes sliding of anti-parallel microtubules but locks together (that is, statically crosslinks) those that are parallel. Using single molecule imaging we show that Ncd diffuses along microtubules in a tail-dependent manner and switches its orientation between sliding microtubules. Our results show that kinesin-14 causes sliding and expansion of an anti-parallel microtubule array by dynamic interactions through the motor domain on the one side and the tail domain on the other. This mechanism accounts for the roles of kinesin-14 in spindle organization.},

Some axosomes emerge from a cut end, attaining sizes up to 250 {$\mu$}m in diameter. Axosomes did not form after axonal injury unless divalent cations (Ca2+ or Mg2+) were present (10 mM) in the external solution. The requirement for Ca2+ and the action of other ions are similar to that for cut-end cytoskeletal constriction in transected squid axons (Gallant, P.E. (1988) J. Neurosci. 8, 1479\textendash 1484) and for electrical sealing in transected axons of the cockroach (Yawo, H. and Kuno, M. (1985) J. Neurosci. 5, 1626\textendash 1632). Axosomes probably consist of membrane from different sources (e.g., axolemma, organelles and Schwann cells); however, localization of axosomal formation to the inner region of the axolemma and the formation dependence on divalent cations suggest principal involvement of cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum. Patch clamp of excised patches from axosomes liberated spontaneously from cut ends of transected axons showed a 12-pS K+ channel and gave indications of other channel types. Injury-induced vesiculation and membrane redistribution seem to be fundamental processes in the short-term (minutes to hours) that precede axonal degeneration or repair and regeneration. Axosomal formation provides a membrane preparation for the study of ion channels and other membrane processes from inaccessible organelles.},

In vivo proteins are generated from at least two sources: labeled amino acids from the diet, and non-labeled amino acids from the degradation of pre-existing proteins. This renders measurements difficult. Here we solved this problem rigorously with a workflow that combines mouse in vivo isotopic labeling, mass spectrometry, and mathematical modeling. We also established several independent approaches to test and validate the results. This enabled us to measure the accurate lifetimes of \textasciitilde 3500 brain proteins.

Here, we examine coordination of motor activity by the scaffolding protein JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP1), which we find is required for long-range anterograde and retrograde amyloid precursor protein (APP) motility in axons. We identify novel interactions between JIP1 and kinesin heavy chain (KHC) that relieve KHC autoinhibition, activating motor function in single molecule assays. The direct binding of the dynactin subunit p150Glued to JIP1 competitively inhibits KHC activation in vitro and disrupts the transport of APP in neurons. Together, these experiments support a model whereby JIP1 coordinates APP transport by switching between anterograde and retrograde motile complexes. We find that mutations in the JNK-dependent phosphorylation site S421 in JIP1 alter both KHC activation in vitro and the directionality of APP transport in neurons. Thus phosphorylation of S421 of JIP1 serves as a molecular switch to regulate the direction of APP transport in neurons.}

To maintain these functional circuits, fast transport delivers RNAs to distal axons where they undergo local translation. However, the mechanism that enables long-distance transport of RNA granules is not yet understood. Here, we demonstrate that a complex containing RNA and the RNA-binding protein (RBP) SFPQ interacts selectively with a tetrameric kinesin containing the adaptor KLC1 and the motor KIF5A. We show that the binding of SFPQ to the KIF5A/KLC1 motor complex is required for axon survival and is impacted by KIF5A mutations that cause Charcot-Marie Tooth (CMT) disease. Moreover, therapeutic approaches that bypass the need for local translation of SFPQ-bound proteins prevent axon degeneration in CMT models. Collectively, these observations indicate that KIF5A-mediated SFPQ-RNA granule transport may be a key function disrupted in KIF5A-linked neurologic diseases and that replacing axonally translated proteins serves as a therapeutic approach to axonal degenerative disorders.}

However, the coordination within a team remains poorly understood as a result of the experimental difficulty in controlling the number and composition of motors. Here, we developed an experimental system that links together defined numbers of motors with defined spacing on a DNA scaffold. By using this system, we linked multiple molecules of two different types of kinesin motors, processive kinesin-1 or nonprocessive Ncd (kinesin-14), in vitro. Both types of kinesins markedly increased their processivities with motor number. Remarkably, despite the poor processivity of individual Ncd motors, the coupling of two Ncd motors enables processive movement for more than 1 {$\mu$}m along microtubules (MTs). This improvement was further enhanced with decreasing spacing between motors. Force measurements revealed that the force generated by groups of Ncd is additive when two to four Ncd motors work together, which is much larger than that generated by single motors. By contrast, the force of multiple kinesin-1s depends only weakly on motor number. Numerical simulations and single-molecule unbinding measurements suggest that this additive nature of the force exerted by Ncd relies on fast MT binding kinetics and the large drag force of individual Ncd motors. These features would enable small groups of Ncd motors to crosslink MTs while rapidly modulating their force by forming clusters. Thus, our experimental system may provide a platform to study the collective behavior of motor proteins from the bottom up.}

Ubiquitination of this permease, like that of some other transporters and receptors, signals endocytosis of the protein, leading to its subsequent vacuolar degradation. This process does not involve the proteasome, which binds and degrades ubiquitin-protein conjugates carrying Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains. The data presented here show that ubiquitination and endocytosis of uracil permease are impaired in yeast cells lacking the Doa4p ubiquitin-isopeptidase. Both processes were rescued by overexpression of wild-type ubiquitin. Mutant ubiquitins carrying Lys--{$>$}Arg mutations at Lys29 and Lys48 restored normal permease ubiquitination. In contrast, a ubiquitin mutated at Lys63 did not restore permease polyubiquitination. Ubiquitin-permease conjugates are therefore extended through the Lys63 of ubiquitin. When polyubiquitination through Lys63 is blocked, the permease still undergoes endocytosis, but at a reduced rate. We have thus identified a natural target of Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains. We have also shown that monoubiquitination is sufficient to induce permease endocytosis, but that Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains appear to stimulate this process.},

Spindly's N-terminal coiled-coil uses distinct motifs to bind dynein light intermediate chain and the pointed-end complex of dynactin. Mutations in these motifs inhibit assembly of a dynein-dynactin-Spindly complex, and a null mutant of the dynactin pointed-end subunit p27 prevents kinetochore recruitment of dynein-dynactin without affecting other mitotic functions of the motor. Conservation of Spindly-like motifs in adaptors involved in intracellular transport suggests a common mechanism for linking dynein to cargo.},

Soluble amyloid-{$\beta$} oligomers (A{$\beta$}Os), a causative agent of AD, activate intracellular signaling cascades that trigger phosphorylation of many target proteins, including tau, resulting in microtubule destabilization and transport impairment. Here, we investigated how KIF1A, a kinesin-3 family motor protein required for the transport of neurotrophic factors, is impaired in mouse hippocampal neurons treated with A{$\beta$}Os. By live cell imaging, we observed that A{$\beta$}Os inhibit transport of KIF1A-GFP similarly in wild-type and tau knock-out neurons, indicating that tau is not required for this effect. Pharmacological inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3{$\beta$} (GSK3{$\beta$}), a kinase overactivated in AD, prevented the transport defects. By mass spectrometry on KIF1A immunoprecipitated from transgenic AD mouse brain, we detected phosphorylation at S402, which conforms to a highly conserved GSK3{$\beta$} consensus site. We confirmed that this site is phosphorylated by GSK3{$\beta$}},

  abstract = {Although actin at neuronal growth cones is well-studied, much less is known about actin organization and dynamics along axon shafts and presynaptic boutons. Using probes that selectively label filamentous-actin (F-actin), we found focal ``actin hotspots'' along axons\textemdash spaced {$\sim$}3\textendash 4 \textmu m apart\textemdash where actin undergoes continuous assembly/disassembly. These foci are a nidus for vigorous actin polymerization, generating long filaments spurting bidirectionally along axons\textemdash a phenomenon we call ``actin trails.'' Super-resolution microscopy reveals intra-axonal deep actin filaments in addition to the subplasmalemmal ``actin rings'' described recently. F-actin hotspots colocalize with stationary axonal endosomes, and blocking vesicle transport diminishes the actin trails, suggesting mechanistic links between vesicles and F-actin kinetics. Actin trails are formin\textemdash but not Arp2/3\textemdash dependent and help enrich actin at presynaptic boutons. Finally, formin inhibition dramatically disrupts synaptic recycling. Collectively, available data suggest a two-tier F-actin organization in axons, with stable ``actin rings'' providing mechanical support to the plasma membrane and dynamic "actin trails" generating a flexible cytoskeletal network with putative physiological roles.}

We demonstrate that intracellular RNA seeds the nucleation of the condensates, as it provides molecular cues to locally coordinate the formation of endogenous high-order RNP assemblies. Interestingly, the co-segregation of intracellular components ultimately impacts the size of the phase-separated condensates. Thus, RNA arises as an architectural element that can influence the composition and the morphological outcome of the condensate phases in an intracellular context.},

The process requires recruitment and precise regulation of motor proteins to form transport-competent mRNPs. We show that the posterior-targeting kinesin-1 is loaded upon nuclear export of oskar mRNPs, prior to their dynein-dependent transport from the nurse cells into the oocyte. We demonstrate that kinesin-1 recruitment requires the DmTropomyosin1-I/C isoform, an atypical RNA-binding tropomyosin that binds directly to dimerizing oskar 3?UTRs. Finally, we show that a small but dynamically changing subset of oskar mRNPs gets loaded with inactive kinesin-1 and that the motor is activated during mid-oogenesis by the functionalized spliced oskar RNA localization element. This inefficient, dynamic recruitment of Khc decoupled from cargo-dependent motor activation constitutes an optimized, coordinated mechanism of mRNP transport, by minimizing interference with other cargo-transport processes and between the cargo-associated dynein and kinesin-1.},

A cytoplasmic form of dynein has also been identified which is involved in mitosis and a wide range of other intracellular movements2 (reviewed in ref. 3). Rapid progress has been made on understanding the mechanism of force production by kinesins and myosins4,5,6,7,8. In contrast, progress in understanding the dyneins has been limited by their great size (relative molecular mass 1,000K\textendash 2,000K) and subunit complexity. We now report evidence that the entire carboxy-terminal two-thirds of the 532K force-producing heavy chain subunit is required for ATP-binding activity. We further identify a microtubule-binding domain, which, surprisingly, lies well downstream of the entire ATPase region and is predicted to form a hairpin-like stalk. Direct ultrastructural analysis of a recombinant fragment confirms this model, and suggests that the mechanism for dynein force production differs substantially from that of other motor proteins.},

After axon injury, we observe~a two-phase process of MT growth upregulation. First,~the number of growing MTs increases at the injury site, concomitant with local downregulation of KLP-7. A second phase of persistent MT growth requires the cytosolic carboxypeptidase CCPP-6, which promotes {$\Delta$}2 modification of {$\alpha$}-tubulin. Both phases of MT growth are coordinated by the DLK-1 MAP kinase cascade. Our results define how the stable MT cytoskeleton of a mature neuron is converted into the dynamically growing MT cytoskeleton of a regrowing axon.},

A major problem with Western blotting is not the method itself, but the use of poor quality antibodies as well as the use of different experimental conditions that affect the linearity and sensitivity of the Western blot. Investigation of some conditions that are commonly used and often modified in Western blotting, as well as some commercial antibodies, showed that published articles often fail to report critical parameters needed to reproduce the results. These parameters include the amount of protein loaded, the blocking solution and conditions used, the amount of primary and secondary antibodies used, the antibody incubation solutions, the detection method and the quantification method utilized. In the present study, comparison of ubiquitinated proteins in rat heart and liver samples showed different results depending on the antibody utilized. Validation of five commercial ubiquitin antibodies using purified ubiquitinated proteins, ubiquitin chains and free ubiquitin showed that these antibodies differ in their ability to detect free ubiquitin or ubiquitinated proteins. Investigating proteins modified with interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) in young and old rat hearts using six commercially available antibodies showed that most antibodies gave different semi-quantitative results, suggesting large variability among antibodies. Evidence showing the importance of the Western blot buffer and the concentration of antibody used is presented. Hence there is a critical need for comprehensive reporting of experimental conditions to improve the accuracy and reproducibility of Western blot analysis. A Western blotting minimal reporting standard (WBMRS) is suggested to improve the reproducibility of Western blot analysis.},

Here, we demonstrate the presence and functionality of pre-mRNA-splicing components in dendrites. When isolated dendrites are transfected with a chicken {$\delta$}-crystallin pre-mRNA or luciferase reporter pre-mRNA, splicing junctions clustered at or near expected splice sites are observed. Additionally, in vitro synaptoneurosome experiments show that this subcellular fraction contains a similar complement of splicing factors that is capable of splicing chicken {$\delta$}-crystallin pre-mRNA. These observations suggest that pre-mRNA-splicing factors found in the dendroplasm retain the potential to promote pre-mRNA splicing.}

  abstract = {To form synaptic connections and store information, neurons continuously remodel their proteomes. The impressive length of dendrites and axons imposes logistical challenges to maintain synaptic proteins at locations remote from the transcription source (the nucleus). The discovery of thousands of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) near synapses suggested that neurons overcome distance and gain autonomy by producing proteins locally. It is not generally known, however, if, how, and when localized mRNAs are translated into protein. To investigate the translational landscape in neuronal subregions, we performed simultaneous RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and ribosome sequencing (Ribo-seq) from microdissected rodent brain slices to identify and quantify the transcriptome and translatome in cell bodies (somata) as well as dendrites and axons (neuropil). Thousands of transcripts were differentially translated between somatic and synaptic regions, with many scaffold and signaling molecules displaying increased translation levels in the neuropil. Most translational changes between compartments could be accounted for by differences in RNA abundance. Pervasive translational regulation was observed in both somata and neuropil influenced by specific mRNA features (e.g., untranslated region [UTR] length, RNA-binding protein [RBP] motifs, and upstream open reading frames [uORFs]). For over 800 mRNAs, the dominant source of translation was the neuropil. We constructed a searchable and interactive database for exploring mRNA transcripts and their translation levels in the somata and neuropil [MPI Brain Research, The mRNA translation landscape in the synaptic neuropil. https://public.brain.mpg.de/dashapps/localseq/. Accessed 5 October 2021]. Overall, our findings emphasize the substantial contribution of local translation to maintaining synaptic protein levels and indicate that on-site translational control is an important mechanism to control synaptic strength.}

  abstract = {The Golgi apparatus (complex) is at the center stage of important functions of processing and transport of plasma membrane, lysosomal, and secreted proteins. The involvement of the Golgi apparatus in the pathogenesis of chronic degenerative diseases of neurons is virtually unknown. In the present study, fragmentation and atrophy of the Golgi apparatus of motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), has been detected with organelle specific antibodies. Approximately 30\% of motor neurons in five ALS patients showed a fragmented Golgi apparatus whereas only about 1\% of motor neurons from seven controls with neurologic or systemic disease showed a similar change. Morphometric studies are consistent with the hypothesis that the alteration of the Golgi apparatus is an early event in the pathogenesis of the neuronal degeneration in ALS. Immunocytochemical studies with antibodies against alpha tubulin, tau, and phosphorylated subunits of neurofilament polypeptides did not disclose differences in the staining of neurons with fragmented or normal Golgi apparatus, suggesting that the alteration of the organelle is not secondary to a gross lesion of the cytoskeleton. However, these observations do not rule out the hypothesis that the fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus is secondary to subtle changes of the polypeptides involved in the attachment of membranes of the organelle to the cytoskeleton.},

Alternatively, these receptors may be targeted for destruction by multiple degradation pathways in the cell.

Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK-5) and its activator CDKA-1/p35 regulate diverse aspects of nervous system development and function. Here, we show that CDK-5 and CDKA-1/p35 are required for the polarized distribution of neuropeptide-containing dense-core vesicles (DCVs) in Caenorhabditis elegans cholinergic motor neurons. In cdk-5 or cdka-1/p35 mutants, the predominantly axonal localization of DCVs containing INS-22 neuropeptides was disrupted and DCVs accumulated in dendrites. Time-lapse microscopy in DB class motor neurons revealed decreased trafficking of DCVs in axons and increased trafficking and accumulation of DCVs in cdk-5 mutant dendrites. The polarized distribution of several axonal and dendritic markers, including synaptic vesicles, was unaltered in cdk-5 mutant DB neurons. We found that microtubule polarity is plus-end out in axons and predominantly minus-end out in dendrites of DB neurons. Surprisingly, cdk-5 mutants had increased amounts of plus-end-out microtubules in dendrites, suggesting that CDK-5 regulates microtubule orientation. However, these changes in microtubule polarity are not responsible for the increased trafficking of DCVs into dendrites. Genetic analysis of cdk-5 and the plus-end-directed axonal DCV motor unc-104/KIF1A suggest that increased trafficking of UNC-104 into dendrites cannot explain the dendritic DCV accumulation. Instead, we found that mutations in the minus-end-directed motor cytoplasmic dynein, completely block the increased DCVs observed in cdk-5 mutant dendrites without affecting microtubule polarity. We propose a model in which CDK-5 regulates DCV polarity by both promoting DCV trafficking in axons and preventing dynein-dependent DCV trafficking into dendrites.},

Using immunofluorescence and phase microscopy the MTOC's of migrating EC were visualized as the cells moved into an in vitro experimental wound produced by mechanical denudation of part of a confluent monolayer culture. Although the MTOC's in nonmigrating EC were randomly positioned in relation to the nucleus, in migrating cells the position of the MTOC's changed so that 80\% of the cells had the MTOC positioned in front of the nucleus toward the direction of movement of the endothelial sheet. This repositioning of the MTOC occurred within the first 4 h after wounding and was associated with the beginning of migration of EC's into the wounded area as seen by time-lapse cinemicrophotography. These studies focus attention on the MTOC as a cytoskeletal structure that may play a role in determining the direction of cell movement.}

Binding of GH to its receptor induces receptor dimerization, resulting in the activation of signal transduction pathways and an increase of GHR ubiquitination. Previously, we have shown that the ubiquitin conjugation system mediates GH-induced GHR internalization. Here, we present evidence that a specific domain of the GHR regulates receptor endocytosis via the ubiquitin conjugation system. This ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis (UbE) motif consists of the amino acid sequence DSWVEFIELD and is homologous to sequences in other proteins, several of which are known to be ubiquitinated. In addition, we show that GH internalization by a truncated GHR is independent of the presence of lysine residues in the cytosolic domain of this receptor, while internalization still depends on an intact ubiquitin conjugation system. Thus, GHR internalization requires the recruitment of the ubiquitin conjugation system to the GHR UbE motif rather than the conjugation of ubiquitin to the GHR itself.},

Here, we use mutations in the dynein heavy chain gene to impair the motor's function, and employ biophysical measurements to demonstrate that cytoplasmic dynein is responsible for the minus end motion of bidirectionally moving lipid droplets in early Drosophila embryos. This analysis yields an estimate for the force that a single cytoplasmic dynein exerts in vivo (1.1 pN). It also allows us to quantitate dynein-mediated cargo motion in vivo, providing a framework for investigating how dynein's activity is controlled. We identify three distinct travel states whose general features also characterize plus end motion. These states are preserved in different developmental stages. We had previously provided evidence that for each travel direction, single droplets are moved by multiple motors of the same type (Welte et al. 1998). Droplet travel distances (runs) are much shorter than expected for multiple motors based on in vitro estimates of cytoplasmic dynein processivity. Therefore, we propose the existence of a process that ends runs before the motors fall off the microtubules. We find that this process acts with a constant probability per unit distance, and is typically coupled to a switch in travel direction. A process with similar properties governs plus end motion, and its regulation controls the net direction of transport.},

Centrifugal and centripetal movement of lysosomes is mediated by kinesin and dynein motors, respectively. We recently described a multi-subunit complex named BORC that recruits the small GTPase Arl8 to lysosomes to promote their kinesin-dependent movement toward the cell periphery. Here, we show that BORC and Arl8 function upstream of two structurally distinct kinesin types: kinesin-1 (KIF5B) and kinesin-3 (KIF1B{$\beta$} and KIF1A). Remarkably, KIF5B preferentially moves lysosomes on perinuclear tracks enriched in acetylated {$\alpha$}-tubulin, whereas KIF1B{$\beta$} and KIF1A drive lysosome movement on more rectilinear, peripheral~tracks enriched in tyrosinated {$\alpha$}-tubulin. These findings establish BORC as a master regulator of lysosome positioning through coupling to different kinesins and microtubule tracks. Common regulation by BORC enables coordinate control of lysosome movement in different regions of the cell.},

Robust neurotransmission depends on the replenishment of synaptic components in a spatially precise manner. Using live-cell microscopy and single-molecule reconstitution assays, we find that the delivery of synaptic vesicle precursors (SVPs) to en passant synapses in hippocampal neurons is specified by an interplay between the kinesin-3 KIF1A motor and presynaptic microtubules. Presynaptic sites are hotspots of dynamic microtubules rich in GTP-tubulin. KIF1A binds more weakly to GTP-tubulin than GDP-tubulin and competes with end-binding (EB) proteins for binding to the microtubule plus end. A disease-causing mutation within KIF1A that reduces preferential binding to GDP- versus GTP-rich microtubules disrupts SVP delivery and reduces presynaptic release upon neuronal stimulation. Thus, the localized enrichment of dynamic microtubules along the~axon specifies a localized unloading zone that ensures the accurate delivery of SVPs, controlling presynaptic strength in hippocampal neurons.},

Recently the enzyme responsible for activation of ubiquitin has been purified to near homogeneity by covalent affinity chromatography. In the present work we demonstrate that the enzyme catalyzes the net reaction (formula: see text); in which both an enzyme-bound COOH-terminal ubiquitin thiolester and a COOH-terminal ubiquitin adenylate are formed. The complex is sufficiently stable to be isolated by exclusion chromatography and contains ubiquitin/AMP in a ratio of 2. The presence of two forms of covalently linked ubiquitin provides a rationale for the observation of both ubiquitin-dependent ATP:PPi and ATP:AMP exchange. Selective derivatization of the thiol site with iodoacetamide results in a modified enzyme capable of catalyzing only ATP:PPi exchange and in forming only ubiquitin adenylate. Derivatization of the thiol site prevents conjugate formation in a reconstituted system, demonstrating that the ubiquitin thiolester is the proximal donor for subsequent conjugate formation. A three-step mechanism is proposed for ubiquitin activation by the enzyme prior to conjugation.},

The midpoint for the transition occurs at ionic strength values of 0.39, 0.25, and 0.18 for pH values of 6.3, 6.9, and 8.3, respectively. Gel filtration experiments indicate that the transition to the 6.5 S species is accompanied by a decrease in the diffusion coefficient. Under all conditions which were tested, the 64-kDa beta subunits comigrate with the 120-kDa alpha subunits without any evidence for dissociation of the alpha 2 beta 2 complex. These results are consistent with the change in sedimentation coefficient being due to a conformational transition between a folded form at low ionic strength and an extended form at high ionic strength. This conformational transition is not significantly affected by the nature of the nucleotide bound at the active site since similar results are obtained both in the presence of excess EDTA, which removes the bound ADP, and after replacement of the bound ADP with adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imino)triphosphate. The alpha 2 form of kinesin, which lacks the beta subunits, undergoes a similar transition between a 6.7 S form at low ionic strength and a 5.1 S form at high ionic strength with a midpoint for the transition at an ionic strength of 0.5 at pH 6.9. Electron microscopic observation also indicates a transition between a folded conformation at low ionic strength and an extended conformation at high ionic strength for both the alpha 2 beta 2 and alpha 2 species.},

Among these are receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which undergo ligand-dependent ubiquitination. The ubiquitination of RTKs has become recognized as an important signal for their endocytosis and degradation in the lysosome; however, it is not clear whether ubiquitination itself is sufficient for this process or simply participates in its regulation. The issue is further complicated by the fact that RTKs are thought to be polyubiquitinated - a modification that is linked to protein degradation by the proteasome. By contrast, monoubiquitination has been associated with diverse proteasome-independent cellular functions including intracellular protein movement. Here we show that the epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors are not polyubiquitinated but rather are monoubiquitinated at multiple sites after their ligand-induced activation. By using different biochemical and molecular genetics approaches, we show that a single ubiquitin is sufficient for both receptor internalization and degradation. Thus, monoubiquitination is the principal signal responsible for the movement of RTKs from the plasma membrane to the lysosome.},

  abstract = {Regeneration of injured neurons can restore function, but most neurons regenerate poorly or not at all. The failure to regenerate in some cases is due to a lack of activation of cell-intrinsic regeneration pathways. Thus, these pathways might be targeted for the development of therapies that can restore neuron function after injury or disease. Here, we show that the DLK-1 MAP kinase pathway is essential for regeneration in C. elegans motor neurons. Loss of this pathway eliminates regeneration, while activating it improves regeneration. Further, these proteins also regulate the later step of growth cone migration. We conclude that after axon injury, activation of this MAP kinase cascade is required to switch the mature neuron from an aplastic state to a state capable of growth.},

In the absence of cargo, kinesin motors are kept inactive to prevent motility and ATP hydrolysis. Current models state that the Kinesin-3 motor KIF1A is monomeric in the inactive state and that activation results from concentration-driven dimerization on the cargo membrane. To test this model, we have examined the activity and dimerization state of KIF1A. Unexpectedly, we found that both native and expressed proteins are dimeric in the inactive state. Thus, KIF1A motors are not activated by cargo-induced dimerization. Rather, we show that KIF1A motors are autoinhibited by two distinct inhibitory mechanisms, suggesting a simple model for activation of dimeric KIF1A motors by cargo binding. Successive truncations result in monomeric and dimeric motors that can undergo one-dimensional diffusion along the microtubule lattice. However, only dimeric motors undergo ATP-dependent processive motility. Thus, KIF1A may be uniquely suited to use both diffuse and processive motility to drive long-distance transport in neuronal cells.},

We show that Kinesin-1 selectivity does not depend on differences between axons and dendrites in microtubule stability or tubulin acetylation, but is likely specified by other tubulin posttranslational modifications., Polarized transport by microtubule-based motors is critical for neuronal development and function. Selective translocation of the Kinesin-1 motor domain is the earliest known marker of axonal identity, occurring before morphological differentiation. Thus, Kinesin-1\textendash mediated transport may contribute to axonal specification. We tested whether posttranslational modifications of tubulin influence the ability of Kinesin-1 motors to distinguish microtubule tracks during neuronal development. We detected no difference in microtubule stability between axons and minor neurites in polarized stage 3 hippocampal neurons. In contrast, microtubule modifications were enriched in a subset of neurites in unpolarized stage 2 cells and the developing axon in polarized stage 3 cells. This enrichment correlated with the selective accumulation of constitutively active Kinesin-1 motors. Increasing tubulin acetylation, without altering the levels of other tubulin modifications, did not alter the selectivity of Kinesin-1 accumulation in polarized cells. However, globally enhancing tubulin acetylation, detyrosination, and polyglutamylation by Taxol treatment or inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3{$\beta$} decreased the selectivity of Kinesin-1 translocation and led to the formation of multiple axons. Although microtubule acetylation enhances the motility of Kinesin-1, the preferential translocation of Kinesin-1 on axonal microtubules in polarized neuronal cells is not determined by acetylation alone but is probably specified by a combination of tubulin modifications.},

These motors must be tightly regulated to ensure the spatial and temporal fidelity of their transport events. Transport motors of the kinesin-1 and kinesin-3 families are regulated by autoinhibition, but little is known about the mechanisms that regulate kinesin-2 motors. We show that the homodimeric kinesin-2 motor KIF17 is kept in an inactive state in the absence of cargo. Autoinhibition is caused by a folded conformation that enables nonmotor regions to directly contact and inhibit the enzymatic activity of the motor domain. We define two molecular mechanisms that contribute to autoinhibition of KIF17. First, the C-terminal tail interferes with microtubule binding; and second, a coiled-coil segment blocks processive motility. The latter is a new mechanism for regulation of kinesin motors. This work supports the model that autoinhibition is a general mechanism for regulation of kinesin motors involved in intracellular trafficking events.}

This phenomenon is termed the 'paradox of co-dependence' of antagonistic motors.Three hypothetical mechanisms are proposed to reconcile this paradox: microtubule tethering, mechanical activation and steric disinhibition. Each makes specific predictions regarding directional switching and the nature of the pause states.A more complete understanding of bidirectional transport will require mathematical modelling to both frame the best experiments and interpret quantitative data.

Here, we use live-cell imaging to systematically probe the microtubule organization in Caenorhabditis\hphantom{,}elegans neurons, and demonstrate the contribution of distinct mechanisms in the organization of dendritic microtubules. We found that most non-ciliated neurons depend on unc-116 (kinesin-1), unc-33 (CRMP) and unc-44 (ankyrin) for correct microtubule organization and polarized cargo transport, as previously reported. Ciliated neurons and the URX neuron, however, use an additional pathway to nucleate microtubules at the tip of the dendrite, from the base of the cilium in ciliated neurons. Since inhibition of distal microtubule nucleation affects distal dendritic transport, we propose a model in which the presence of a microtubule-organizing center at the dendrite tip ensures correct dendritic cargo transport.}

E3 enzymes are thought to determine the substrate specificity of ubiquitination and have been classified into two families, the HECT and RING finger families. Six mammalian U box proteins have now been shown to mediate polyubiquitination in the presence of E1 and E2 and in the absence of E3. These U box proteins exhibited different specificities for E2 enzymes in this reaction. Deletion of the U box or mutation of conserved amino acids within it abolished ubiquitination activity. Some U box proteins catalyzed polyubiquitination by targeting lysine residues of ubiquitin other than lysine 48, which is utilized by HECT and RING finger E3 enzymes for polyubiquitination that serves as a signal for proteolysis by the 26 S proteasome. These data suggest that U box proteins constitute a third family of E3 enzymes and that E4 activity may reflect a specialized type of E3 activity.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this study, the number of active UNC-104 molecules hauling a single SVP in axons in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans was counted by applying a newly developed non-invasive force measurement technique. The distribution of the force acting on a SVP transported by UNC-104 was spread out over several clusters, implying the presence of several force-producing units (FPUs). We then compared the number of FPUs in the wild-type worms with that in arl-8 gene-deletion mutant worms. ARL-8 is a SVP-bound arf-like small guanosine triphosphatase, and is known to promote unlocking of the autoinhibition of the motor, which is critical for avoiding unnecessary consumption of adenosine triphosphate when the motor does not bind to a SVP. There were fewer FPUs in the arl-8 mutant worms. This finding indicates that a lack of ARL-8 decreased the number of active UNC-104 motors, which then led to a decrease in the number of motors responsible for SVP transport.},

Although in vitro single-molecule experiments have been performed to primarily investigate the kinesin motor domain, these have not addressed the in vivo reality of the existence of regulatory proteins, such as ARL-8, that control kinesin attachment to/detachment from cargo vesicles, which is essential to the overall transport efficiency of cargo vesicles.

Our future aim is to facilitate the construction of a consensus physical model to connect SVP transport with pathologies related to deficient synapse construction caused by the deficient UNC-104 regulation.

  abstract = {In Aplysia, behavioral sensitization of defensive reflexes and the underlying presynaptic facilitation of sensory-to-motor neuron synapses lasts for several minutes (short term) or days to weeks (long term). Short-term sensitization has been explained by modulation of ion-channel function through cAMP-dependent protein phosphorylation. Long-term facilitation requires additional molecular changes including protein synthesis. A key event is the persistent activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase at baseline concentrations of cAMP. This activation is due to selective loss of regulatory (R) subunits of PKA without any change in catalytic (C) subunits. To understand the molecular mechanisms that produce the loss of R subunits in long-term facilitation, we investigated how R subunits are degraded in extracts of Aplysia nervous tissue and in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. Degradation of Aplysia R subunits requires ATP, ubiquitin, and a particulate component that appears to be the proteasome complex. Degradation is blocked by hemin, which causes the accumulation of high molecular weight derivatives of R subunits that are likely to be ubiquitin conjugates of R subunits and intermediates in the degradative pathway. We also show that vertebrate RI and RII subunits can be degraded through the ubiquitin pathway. We suggest that degradation is initiated by cAMP, which causes the holoenzyme to dissociate and, further, that the altered R-to-C ratio in Aplysia sensory neurons is maintained in long-term facilitation by newly synthesized proteins that help target R subunits for accelerated degradation.}

This rapidly induced gene encodes an enzyme that associates with the proteasome and increases its proteolytic activity. This regulated proteolysis is essential for long-term facilitation.

Despite progress in defining the molecular properties and substrates of parkin, little is known about its physiological function. Here, we show that parkin regulates the function and stability of excitatory glutamatergic synapses. Postsynaptic expression of parkin dampens excitatory synaptic transmission and causes a marked loss of excitatory synapses onto hippocampal neurons. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous parkin or expression of PD-linked parkin mutants profoundly enhances synaptic efficacy and triggers a proliferation of glutamatergic synapses. This proliferation is associated with increased vulnerability to synaptic excitotoxicity. Thus, parkin negatively regulates the number and strength of excitatory synapses. Increased excitatory drive produced by disruption of parkin may contribute to the pathophysiology of PD.}

Recently, novel methods were established that enable the identification of site-specific sumoylation, leading to the identification of thousands of modified Lys residues.We have compiled and evaluated data of sumoylated proteins and sites from 22 proteomic studies and generated the most comprehensive sumoylation database to date.The most abundantly sumoylated proteins are some of the most functionally interconnected proteins, indicating that sumoylation preferentially targets specific pathways and protein complexes and acts as a group modifier.The regulation of the SUMO signal is more complex than previously appreciated, owing to the post-translational modification of SUMO family members by phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitylation.With the availability of increasingly potent proteomic methods and equipment, our understanding of sumoylation and its functions can now be developed to match that of ubiquitylation, acetylation and phosphorylation.},

  abstract = {The process of cell division is highly complex. The DNA of the genome most be accurately replicated and segregated into two precisely equal portions; the cytoskeleton must be actively rearranged; and the cellular motor forces that allow the separation of the replicated chromosomes and the splitting of the mother cell into two daughters must be kept under strict spatial and temporal regulation. Not surprisingly for a process of this complexity, there is a wide range of proteins whose location and activity must be accurately controlled to ensure both efficiency and precision. Although the demands placed on these cell cycle proteins are high, once cells such as neurons differentiate they enter a long non-mitotic phase where evolution has conspired to repurpose many of these proteins, leading them to assume new and often unrelated cellular tasks. In neurons there is a wide range of non-cycling functions for these `cell cycle' proteins and this review covers some of the best-known examples. There is little apparent logic to the second use, but the sheer number of examples suggests that there must be a significant evolutionary advantage to this repurposing strategy.},

APF-1 and lysozyme, a good substrate for ATP-dependent proteolysis, form multiple conjugates, as was shown by comigration of label from each upon gel electrophoresis. Multiple bands were also seen with other substrates of the ATP-dependent proteolytic system, such as globin or alpha-lactalbumin. Analysis of the ratio of APF-1 to lysozyme radioactivities and of the molecular weights of the bands indicated that they consist of increasing numbers of the APF-1 polypeptide bound to one molecule of lysozyme. The covalent linkage is probably of an isopeptide nature, because it is stable to hydroxylamine and alkali, and polylysine is able to give conjugates of APF-1. Removal of ATP after formation of the 125I-labeled APF-1 conjugates with endogenous proteins caused the regeneration of APF-1, indicating presence of an amidase. This reaction is thought to compete with proteases that may act on APF-1-protein conjugates, especially those containing several APF-1 ligands. A sequence of reactions in which the linkage of APF-1 to the substrate is followed by the proteolytic breakdown of the substrate is proposed to explain the role of ATP.},

Ligand binding also induces ubiquitination of the Ste2p cytoplasmic tail. Protein ubiquitination is required for stimulated endocytosis of Ste2p, as internalization is 5- to 15-fold slower in ubc mutants that lack multiple ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. In a C-terminal truncated form of Ste2p that is rapidly ubiquitinated and endocytosed in response to ligand binding, a single lysine to arginine substitution in its cytoplasmic tail eliminates both ubiquitination and internalization. Thus, ubiquitination of Ste2p itself is required for ligand-stimulated endocytosis. We propose that ubiquitination mediates degradation of receptor-ligand complexes, not via the proteasome, but by acting as a signal for endocytosis leading to subsequent degradation in the lysosome/vacuole.},

  abstract = {Multi-ubiquitin chains target proteins for destruction by the proteasome. However, several proteins are monoubiquitylated. Recently, monoubiquitin has emerged as a regulator of the location and activity of diverse cellular proteins. Histone regulation: Core histones H2A and H2B and the linker histone H1 are monoubiquitylated. Ubiquitylation of histones is important for gene expression during meiosis and development. Endocytosis: Monoubiquitin serves as a signal to trigger the regulated internalization of plasma membrane proteins. Monoubiquitylation might also regulate the activity of components of the endocytic machinery. Virus budding: The retrovirus Gag polyprotein is monoubiquitylated and this modification is required for late stages of virus budding from infected cells. Surface regions of ubiquitin that are important for its different functions have been defined. One hydrophobic patch is promiscuous and is crucial for such diverse processes as proteasomal degradation and endocytosis. Another surface patch is important only for endocytosis and might have a role specifically in monoubiquitin functions. Modification with monoubiquitin might regulate protein location and activity in ways that are similar to modification with the ubiquitin-like proteins, SUMO-1, Rub1 and Apg12. Regulation of ubiquitin modification is important so that monoubiquitylated proteins are not inappropriately multi-ubiquitylated and degraded. Monoubiquitylation could be regulated by the activity of specific components of the ubiquitin machinery, by de-ubiquitylating enzymes, or by the presence or absence of positive and negative regulators of multi-ubiquitin chain assembly. Many more monoubiquitin proteins probably exist and remain to be identified. The mechanism by which monoubiquitin regulates substrate protein location and activity is a mystery that is the next big challenge for researchers in the field.},

Vesicles and mitochondria moved bidirectionally in the central parts of fresh or permeabilized-reactivated axons. Although the axoplasm of the fresh axon was composed of longitudinally oriented microtubules and granular materials in which membrane organelles were embedded, a network of fine strands existed in the core of the granular materials. Crossbridges between membrane organelles and microtubules were present. In the central part of reactivated axons, the cytoskeleton consisted of microtubules, highly anastomosing networks of fine strands (6.6 {$\pm$} 1.4 nm in width) that crosslinked the microtubules with each other, and relatively short, straight crossbridges (25 {$\pm$} 3.9 nm in length, 5.5 {$\pm$} 2.1 nm in width) crosslinking membrane organelles with microtubules. It has been shown that a 270KD microtubule associated protein (MAP) could be a main component of crossbridges between MTs [Hirokawa, 1986]. Hence the dynamic conformational change of crossbridges between membrane organelles and microtubules could play an important role when membrane organelles are transported.},

In vitro studies suggested that kinesin moves organelles preferentially in the anterograde direction, but data about the function and precise localization of kinesin in the living axon were lacking. The current study was undertaken to establish whether kinesin associates with anterograde or retrograde moving organelles in vivo. Peripheral nerves were ligated to produce accumulations of organelles moving in defined directions. Regions proximal (anterograde) and distal (retrograde) to the ligation were analyzed for kinesin localization by immunofluorescence, and by immunogold electron microscopy using ultracryomicrotomy. Substantial amounts of kinesin were associated with anterograde moving organelles on the proximal side, while significantly less kinesin was detected distally. Statistical analyses indicated that kinesin was mostly associated with membrane-bounded organelles. These observations indicate that axonal kinesin is primarily associated with anterograde moving organelles in vivo.}

Here, we demonstrate that monoubiquitination of the endocytic proteins Sts1, Sts2, Eps15 and Hrs results in intramolecular interactions between ubiquitin and their UBDs, thereby preventing them from binding in trans to ubiquitinated targets. Permanent monoubiquitination of these proteins, mimicked by the fusion of ubiquitin to their carboxyl termini, impairs their ability to regulate trafficking of ubiquitinated receptors. Moreover, we mapped the in vivo monoubiquitination site in Sts2 and demonstrated that its mutation enhances the Sts2-mediated effects of epidermal-growth-factor-receptor downregulation.

  abstract = {Axonal transport involves kinesin motors trafficking cargo along microtubules that are rich in microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). Much attention has focused on the behavior of kinesin-1 in the presence of MAPs, which has overshadowed understanding the contribution of other kinesins such as kinesin-2 in axonal transport. We have previously shown that, unlike kinesin-1, kinesin-2 in vitro motility is insensitive to the neuronal MAP Tau. However, the mechanism by which kinesin-2 efficiently navigates Tau on the microtubule surface is unknown. We hypothesized that mammalian kinesin-2 side-steps to adjacent protofilaments to maneuver around MAPs. To test this, we used single-molecule imaging to track the characteristic run length and protofilament switching behavior of kinesin-1 and kinesin-2 motors in the absence and presence of 2 different microtubule obstacles. Under all conditions tested, kinesin-2 switched protofilaments more frequently than kinesin-1. Using computational modeling that recapitulates run length and switching frequencies in the presence of varying roadblock densities, we conclude that kinesin-2 switches protofilaments to navigate around microtubule obstacles. Elucidating the kinesin-2 mechanism of navigation on the crowded microtubule surface provides a refined view of its contribution in facilitating axonal transport.},

Genetic mutations in unc-43, or spatially and temporally restricted inactivation of UNC-43/CaMKII, revealed its essential roles in the transport of AMPARs from the cell body and in the insertion and removal of synaptic AMPARs. We found that an essential target of UNC-43/CaMKII is kinesin light chain and that mouse CaMKII rescued unc-43 mutants, suggesting conservation of function. Transient expression of UNC-43/CaMKII in adults rescued the transport defects, while optogenetic stimulation of select synapses revealed CaMKII's role in activity-dependent plasticity. Our results demonstrate unanticipated, fundamentally important roles for UNC-43/CaMKII in the regulation of synaptic strength.},

  abstract = {The role of neurofilaments, the intermediate filaments of nerve cells, has been conjectural. Previous morphological studies have suggested a close relationship between neurofilament content and axonal caliber. In this study, the regenerating neuron was used as a model system for testing the hypotheses that neurofilaments are intrinsic determinants of axonal caliber, and that neurofilament content is controlled by the axonal transport of neurofilaments. This system was chosen because previous studies had shown that, after axotomy, axonal caliber was reduced within the proximal stump of the regenerating nerve and, because the relative amount of neurofilament protein undergoing axonal transport in regenerating axons was selectively reduced. The relationship between axonal caliber and neurofilament number was examined in a systematic fashion in both regenerating and control motor axons in rat L5 ventral root. Reconstruction of the spatial and temporal sequences of axonal atrophy in the proximal stump after axotomy showed that reductions in axonal caliber were first detected in the most proximal region of the root and subsequently progressed in a proximal-to-distal direction at a rate of 1.7 mm/day, which is identical to the rate of neurofilament transport in these neurons. Quantitative ultrastructural studies showed that these reductions in caliber correlated with a proportional decrease in the number of axonal neurofilaments but not microtubules. These results support the hypotheses that neurofilament content is a major intrinsic determinant of axonal caliber and that neurofilament content is controlled by the axonal transport of neurofilaments. On this basis, we suggest a role for neurofilaments in the control of axonal volume.}

These organelles are variable in diameter (typically between 0.2 and 2 microns) and undergo saltatory movements both towards and away from the neuronal cell body. Their mean velocities vary inversely with the size of the organelle and are greater in the retrograde than the anterograde direction. Organelles stain with the lipophilic dye 1, 1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine and with antibodies to cytoskeletal components. In cultures double-stained with antibodies to alpha-tubulin and 70-kD neurofilament protein (NF-L), approximately 40\% of the organelles stain for tubulin, 30\% stain for NF-L, 10\% stain for both tubulin and NF-L, and 40\% show no staining with either antibody. The association of cytoskeletal proteins with the organelles shows that these proteins are able to move by a form of rapid axonal transport. Under most culture conditions the predominant direction of movement is towards the cell body, suggesting that the organelles are produced at or near the growth cone. Retrograde movements continue in culture medium lacking protein or high molecular mass components and increase under conditions in which the advance of the growth cone is arrested. There is a fourfold increase in the number of organelles moving retrogradely in neurites that encounter a substratum-associated barrier to elongation; retrograde movements increase similarly in cultures exposed to cytochalasin at levels known to block growth cone advance. No previously described organelle shows behavior coordinated with axonal growth in this way. We propose that the organelles contain membrane and cytoskeletal components that have been delivered to the growth cone, by slow or fast anterograde transport, in excess of the amounts required to synthesize more axon. In view of their rapid mobility and variable contents, we suggest that they be called "neuronal parcels."}

This rapid deglutamylation quickly leads to altered ciliary functions such as kinesin-2-mediated anterograde intraflagellar transport and Hedgehog signaling, along with no apparent crosstalk to other PTMs such as acetylation and detyrosination. Our study offers a feasible approach to spatiotemporally manipulate tubulin PTMs in living cells.

The path kinesin follows along the surface of the microtubule is parallel to the protofilaments, and the steps are likely separated by 8 nm, the length of the tubulin dimer. Micromechanical recordings from single kinesin molecules indicate that one motor can exert a force as great as 5 pN. The efficiency of kinesin probably is in the order of 50\%, considering the free energy available from ATP hydrolysis.

The project has evolved from its original remit to collect and integrate all data for a single species, and now extends to numerous nematodes, ranging from evolutionary comparators of C. elegans to parasitic species that threaten plant, animal and human health. Research activity using C. elegans as a model system is as vibrant as ever, and we have created new tools for community curation in response to the ever-increasing volume and complexity of data. To better allow users to navigate their way through these data, we have made a number of improvements to our main website, including new tools for browsing genomic features and ontology annotations. Finally, we have developed a new portal for parasitic worm genomes. WormBase ParaSite (parasite.wormbase.org) contains all publicly available nematode and platyhelminth annotated genome sequences, and is designed specifically to support helminth genomic research.},

Long-range anterograde transport of TrkB in axons and dendrites requires kinesin-mediated transport. However, it remains unknown whether anterograde TrkB transport mechanisms are the same in axons versus in dendrites. Here, we show that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-interacting protein 3 (JIP3) binds directly to TrkB, via a minimal 12 aa domain in the TrkB juxtamembrane region, and links TrkB to kinesin-1. The JIP3/TrkB interaction selectively drives TrkB anterograde transport in axons but not in dendrites of rat hippocampal neurons. Moreover, we find that TrkB axonal transport mediated by JIP3 could regulate BDNF-induced Erk activation and axonal filopodia formation. Our findings demonstrate a role for JIP3-mediated TrkB anterograde axonal transport in recruiting more TrkB into distal axons and facilitating BDNF-induced retrograde signaling and synapse modulation, which provides a novel mechanism of how the TrkB anterograde transport can be coupled to BDNF signaling in distal axons.},

  abstract = {Alphaherpesviruses, including pseudorabies virus (PRV), are neuroinvasive pathogens that establish lifelong latency in peripheral ganglia following the initial infection at mucosal surfaces. The establishment of latent infection and subsequent reactivations, during which newly assembled virions are sorted into and transported anterogradely inside axons to the initial mucosal site of infection, rely on axonal bidirectional transport mediated by microtubule-based motors. Previous studies using cultured peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons have demonstrated that KIF1A, a kinesin-3 motor, mediates the efficient axonal sorting and transport of newly assembled PRV virions. Here we report that KIF1A, unlike other axonal kinesins, is an intrinsically unstable protein prone to proteasomal degradation. Interestingly, PRV infection of neuronal cells leads not only to a nonspecific depletion of KIF1A mRNA but also to an accelerated proteasomal degradation of KIF1A proteins, leading to a near depletion of KIF1A protein late in infection. Using a series of PRV mutants deficient in axonal sorting and anterograde spread, we identified the PRV US9/gE/gI protein complex as a viral factor facilitating the proteasomal degradation of KIF1A proteins. Moreover, by using compartmented neuronal cultures that fluidically and physically separate axons from cell bodies, we found that the proteasomal degradation of KIF1A occurs in axons during infection. We propose that the PRV anterograde sorting complex, gE/gI/US9, recruits KIF1A to viral transport vesicles for axonal sorting and transport and eventually accelerates the proteasomal degradation of KIF1A in axons. IMPORTANCE Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is an alphaherpesvirus related to human pathogens herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 and varicella-zoster virus. Alphaherpesviruses are neuroinvasive pathogens that establish lifelong latent infections in the host peripheral nervous system (PNS). Following reactivation from latency, infection spreads from the PNS back via axons to the peripheral mucosal tissues, a process mediated by kinesin motors. Here, we unveil and characterize the underlying mechanisms for a PRV-induced, accelerated degradation of KIF1A, a kinesin-3 motor promoting the sorting and transport of PRV virions in axons. We show that PRV infection disrupts the synthesis of KIF1A and simultaneously promotes the degradation of intrinsically unstable KIF1A proteins by proteasomes in axons. Our work implies that the timing of motor reduction after reactivation would be critical because progeny particles would have a limited time window for sorting into and transport in axons for further host-to-host spread.},

Identifying how motors interact with specific types of transport vesicles has been challenging. Here, we use engineered motors and cargo adaptors to systematically investigate the selectivity and regulation of kinesin-3 family member KIF1A-driven transport of dense core vesicles (DCVs), lysosomes, and synaptic vesicles (SVs). We dissect the role of KIF1A domains in motor activity and show that CC1 regulates autoinhibition, CC2 regulates motor dimerization, and CC3 and PH mediate cargo binding. Furthermore, we identify that phosphorylation of KIF1A is critical for binding to vesicles. Cargo specificity is achieved by specific KIF1A adaptors; MADD/Rab3GEP links KIF1A to SVs, and Arf-like GTPase Arl8A mediates interactions with DCVs and lysosomes. We propose a model where motor dimerization, posttranslational modifications, and specific adaptors regulate selective KIF1A cargo trafficking.},

KIF1A is the neuron-specific kinesin with the fastest reported anterograde motor activity. Previous studies have shown that KIF1A transports a subset of synaptic proteins, neurofilaments and dense-core vesicles. Using two-colour live imaging, we showed that beta-secretase 1 (BACE1)-mCherry moves together with KIF1A-GFP in both the anterograde and retrograde directions in superior cervical ganglions (SCG) neurons. We confirmed that KIF1A is functionally required for BACE1 transport by using KIF1A siRNA and a KIF1A mutant construct (KIF1A-T312M) to impair its motor activity. We further identified several cargoes that have little or no co-migration with KIF1A-GFP and also move independently from BACE1-mCherry. Together, these findings support a primary role for KIF1A in the anterograde transport of BACE1 and suggest that axonally transported cargoes are sorted into different classes of carrier vesicles in the cell body and are transported by cargo-specific motor proteins through the axon.},

These physiological defects cause progressive distal paralysis in larvae. To identify the cellular defects that cause these phenotypes, larval nerves were studied by light and electron microscopy. The axons of Khc mutants develop dramatic focal swellings along their lengths. The swellings are packed with fast axonal transport cargoes including vesicles, synaptic membrane proteins, mitochondria and prelysosomal organelles, but not with slow axonal transport cargoes such as cytoskeletal elements. Khc mutations also impair the development of larval motor axon terminals, causing dystrophic morphology and marked reductions in synaptic bouton numbers. These observations suggest that as the concentration of maternally provided wild-type KHC decreases, axonal organelles transported by kinesin periodically stall. This causes organelle jams that disrupt retrograde as well as anterograde fast axonal transport, leading to defective action potentials, dystrophic terminals, reduced transmitter secretion and progressive distal paralysis. These phenotypes parallel the pathologies of some vertebrate motor neuron diseases, including some forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and suggest that impaired fast axonal transport is a key element in those diseases.}

The carboxyl termini of {$\alpha$}- and {$\beta$}-tubulin can undergo different posttranslational modifications, including polyglutamylation, which is particularly abundant within the mammalian nervous system. Thus, this modification could serve as a molecular ``traffic sign'' for motor proteins in neuronal cells. To investigate whether polyglutamylated {$\alpha$}-tubulin could perform this function, we analyzed ROSA22 mice that lack functional PGs1, a subunit of {$\alpha$}-tubulin-selective polyglutamylase. In wild-type mice, polyglutamylated {$\alpha$}-tubulin is abundant in both axonal and dendritic neurites. ROSA22 mutants display a striking loss of polyglutamylated {$\alpha$}-tubulin within neurons, including their neurites, which is associated with decreased binding affinity of certain structural microtubule-associated proteins and motor proteins, including kinesins, to microtubules purified from ROSA22-mutant brain. Of the kinesins examined, KIF1A, a subfamily of kinesin-3, was less abundant in neurites from ROSA22 mutants in vitro and in vivo, whereas the distribution of KIF3A (kinesin-2) and KIF5 (kinesin-1) appeared unaltered. The density of synaptic vesicles, a cargo of KIF1A, was decreased in synaptic terminals in the CA1 region of hippocampus in ROSA22 mutants. Consistent with this finding, ROSA22 mutants displayed more rapid depletion of synaptic vesicles than wild-type littermates after high-frequency stimulation. These data provide evidence for a role of polyglutamylation of {$\alpha$}-tubulin in vivo, as a molecular traffic sign for targeting of KIF1 kinesin required for continuous synaptic transmission.}

It has been previously suggested that the microtubule-associated motor protein kinesin, which transports cargo toward the plus end of microtubules, plays a role in translocating GLUT4 vesicles to the cell surface. In this study, we investigated the role of Rab4, a small GTPase-binding protein, and the motor protein KIF3 (kinesin II in mice) in insulin-induced GLUT4 exocytosis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Photoaffinity labeling of Rab4 with [{$\gamma$}-32P]GTP-azidoanilide showed that insulin stimulated Rab4 GTP loading and that this insulin effect was inhibited by pretreatment with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) inhibitor LY294002 or expression of dominant-negative protein kinase C-{$\lambda$} (PKC-{$\lambda$}). Consistent with previous reports, expression of dominant-negative Rab4 (N121I) decreased insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation by 45\%. Microinjection of an anti-KIF3 antibody into 3T3-L1 adipocytes decreased insulin-induced GLUT4 exocytosis by 65\% but had no effect on endocytosis. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that Rab4, but not Rab5, physically associated with KIF3, and this was confirmed by showing in vitro association using glutathione S-transferase-Rab4. A microtubule capture assay demonstrated that insulin stimulation increased the activity for the binding of KIF3 to microtubules and that this activation was inhibited by pretreatment with the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 or expression of dominant-negative PKC-{$\lambda$}. Taken together, these data indicate that (i) insulin signaling stimulates Rab4 activity, the association of Rab4 with kinesin, and the interaction of KIF3 with microtubules and (ii) this process is mediated by insulin-induced PI3-kinase-dependent PKC-{$\lambda$} activation and participates in GLUT4 exocytosis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.},

In this study, using a single-molecule fluorescence assay, we show that bacterially expressed OSM-3 in solution does not move processively (multiple steps along a microtubule without dissociation) and displays low microtubule-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity. However, a point mutation (G444E) in a predicted hinge region of OSM-3's coiled-coil stalk as well as a deletion of that hinge activate ATPase activity and induce robust processive movement. These hinge mutations also cause a conformational change in OSM-3, causing it to adopt a more extended conformation. The motility of wild-type OSM-3 also can be activated by attaching the motor to beads in an optical trap, a situation that may mimic attachment to IFT cargo. Our results suggest that OSM-3 motility is repressed by an intramolecular interaction that involves folding about a central hinge and that IFT cargo binding relieves this autoinhibition in vivo. Interestingly, the G444E allele in C. elegans produces similar ciliary defects to an osm-3\textendash null mutation, suggesting that autoinhibition is important for OSM-3's biological function.}

  abstract = {Guanine nucleotide exchange is essential for Rab GTPase activities in regulating intracellular vesicle trafficking. This exchange process is facilitated by guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). Previously, we identified Caenorhabditis elegans AEX-3 as a GEF for Rab3 GTPase. Here we demonstrate that AEX-3 regulates neural activities through a second, previously unrecognized pathway via interactions with the novel protein CAB-1. CAB-1 is 425 amino acids long and has an 80 amino acid motif in common with the mouse neural protein NPDC-1. cab-1 and rab-3 mutants have different behavioral defects, and RAB-3 localization and function are apparently normal in cab-1 mutants, indicating that the CAB-1 pathway is distinct from the RAB-3 pathway. The aex-3 mutant phenotype resembles the sum of the rab-3 and cab-1 mutant phenotypes, indicating that AEX-3 regulates two different pathways for neural activities. We propose that connection of multiple pathways may be an important feature of Rab GEFs to coordinate various cellular events.},

Throughout development, truncated Kinesin-3 accumulates at the tips of all neurites. In contrast, Kinesin-1 selectively accumulates in only a subset of neurites. Before neurons become polarized, truncated Kinesin-1 accumulates transiently in a single neurite. Coincident with axon specification, truncated Kinesin-1 accumulates only in the emerging axon and no longer appears in any other neurite. The translocation of Kinesin-1 along a biochemically distinct track leading to the nascent axon could ensure the selective delivery of Kinesin-1 cargoes to the axon and hence contribute to its molecular specification. Imaging YFP-tagged truncated Kinesin-1 provides the most precise definition to date of when neuronal polarity first emerges and allows visualization of the molecular differentiation of the axon in real time.},

  abstract = {Synaptic transmission relies on the continual exocytosis and recycling of synaptic vesicles. Aged vesicle proteins are prevented from recycling and are eventually degraded. This implies that active synapses would lose vesicles and vesicle-associated proteins over time, unless the supply correlates to activity, to balance the losses. To test this hypothesis, we first model the quantitative relation between presynaptic spike rate and vesicle turnover. The model predicts that the vesicle supply needs to increase with the spike rate. To follow up this prediction, we measure protein turnover in individual synapses of cultured hippocampal neurons by combining nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS) and fluorescence microscopy. We find that turnover correlates with activity at the single-synapse level, but not with other parameters such as the abundance of synaptic vesicles or postsynaptic density proteins. We therefore suggest that the supply of newly synthesized proteins to synapses is closely connected to synaptic activity.},

It is involved in the elimination of misfolded, altered or aged proteins as well as in the generation of antigenic peptides presented by MHC class I molecules. It is also responsible for the proteolytic maturation of diverse polypeptide precursors and for the spatial and temporal regulation of the degradation of many key cell regulators whose destruction is necessary for progression through essential processes, such as cell division, differentiation and, more generally, adaptation to environmental signals. It is generally believed that proteins must undergo prior modification by polyubiquitin chains to be addressed to, and recognized by, the proteasome. In reality, however, there is accumulating evidence that ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation may have been largely underestimated. In particular, a number of proto-oncoproteins and oncosuppressive proteins are privileged ubiquitin-independent proteasomal substrates, the altered degradation of which may have tumorigenic consequences. The identification of ubiquitin-independent mechanisms for proteasomal degradation also poses the paramount question of the multiplicity of catabolic pathways targeting each protein substrate. As this may help design novel therapeutic strategies, the underlying mechanisms are critically reviewed here.},

Little is known about the mechanisms of the ciliary targeting of olfactory CNG channels, composed of three subunits: CNGA2, CNGA4, and CNGB1b . Recent reports suggest that subunit composition of the retinal CNG channel influences localization, leading to disease . However, the mechanistic role of subunits in properly targeting native olfactory CNG channels remains unclear. Here, we show that heteromeric assembly with CNGB1b, containing a critical carboxy-terminal motif (RVxP), is required for ciliary trafficking of olfactory CNG channels. Movement of proteins within the cilia is governed by intraflagellar transport (IFT), a process that facilitates bidirectional movement of cargo along microtubules. Work in C. elegans has established that heterotrimeric and homodimeric kinesin-2 family members play a critical role in anterograde transport . In mammalian systems, the heterotrimeric KIF3a/KIF3b/KAP-3 complex plays a clear role in IFT; however, no role has been established for KIF17, the mammalian homolog of OSM-3 . Here, we demonstrate that KIF17 is required for olfactory CNG channel targeting, providing novel insights into mechanisms of mammalian ciliary transport.},

Local protein synthesis in axon tips plays an important role in axon retraction and regeneration. Microarray and RNA-seq studies on cultured mammalian embryonic or early postnatal peripheral neurons showed that axon growth cones contain hundreds to thousands of mRNAs. In the lamprey, identified reticulospinal neurons vary in the probability that their axons will regenerate after axotomy. The bad regenerators undergo early severe axon retraction and very delayed apoptosis. We micro-aspirated axoplasms from 10 growing, 9 static and 5 retracting axon tips of spinal cord transected lampreys and performed single-cell RNA-seq, analyzing the results bioinformatically. Genes were identified that were upregulated selectively in growing (n = 38), static (20) or retracting tips (18). Among them, map3k2, csnk1e and gtf2h were expressed in growing tips, mapk8(1) was expressed in static tips and prkcq was expressed in retracting tips. Venn diagrams revealed more than 40 components of MAPK signaling pathways, including jnk and p38 isoforms, which were differentially distributed in growing, static and/or retracting tips. Real-time q-PCR and immunohistochemistry verified the colocalization of map3k2 and csnk1e in growing axon tips. Thus, differentially regulated MAPK and circadian rhythm signaling pathways may be involved in activating either programs for axon regeneration or axon retraction and apoptosis.},

Land plants, however, are a notable exception, because they contain a large number of kinesins but lack cytoplasmic dynein, the foremost processive retrograde transporter. It remains unclear how plants achieve retrograde cargo transport without dynein. Here, we have analysed the motility of the six members of minus-end-directed kinesin-14 motors in the moss Physcomitrella patens and found that none are processive as native dimers. However, when artificially clustered into as little as dimer of dimers, the type-VI kinesin-14 (a homologue of Arabidopsis KCBP (kinesin-like calmodulin binding protein)) exhibited highly processive and fast motility (up to 0.6\hspace{0.25em}{$\mu$}m\hspace{0.25em}s-1). Multiple kin14-VI dimers attached to liposomes also induced transport of this membrane cargo over several microns. Consistent with these results, in vivo observations of green fluorescent protein-tagged kin14-VI in moss cells revealed fluorescent punctae that moved processively towards the minus-ends of the cytoplasmic MTs. These data suggest that clustering of a kinesin-14 motor serves as a dynein-independent mechanism for retrograde transport in plants.},

It is largely unclear how motor proteins are targeted specifically to different compartments. Rab GTPases recruit and/or activate several proteins involved in membrane fusion and vesicular transport. They associate with specific compartments after activation, which makes Rab GTPases ideal candidates for controlling motor protein binding to specific membranes. We and others [7] have identified a protein, called RILP (for Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein), that interacts with active Rab7 on late endosomes and lysosomes. Here we show that RILP prevents further cycling of Rab7. RILP expression induces the recruitment of functional dynein-dynactin motor complexes to Rab7-containing late endosomes and lysosomes. Consequently, these compartments are transported by these motors toward the minus end of microtubules, effectively inhibiting their transport toward the cell periphery. This signaling cascade may be responsible for timed and selective dynein motor recruitment onto late endosomes and lysosomes.},

Northern blot analysis showed that the NEDD8 message was developmentally down-regulated. In adult tissues, NEDD8 expression was mostly restricted to the heart and skeletal muscle. Antiserum specific for NEDD8 detected a 6-kDa monomer in SK-N-SH, BJAB, and HL60 cell lysates. A 14-kDa band was also detected in BJAB, HL60, and SK-MEL28 but not in SK-N-SH and K562 cell lysates. An approximately 90-kDa band was detected in all cell lines tested. Thus, NEDD8 is likely to be conjugated to other proteins in a manner analogous to ubiquitination. However, the conjugation pattern of NEDD8 is entirely different from that of ubiquitin in all cell lines tested. To study NEDD8 conjugation in more detail, hemagglutinin-epitope-tagged NEDD8 was expressed in COS cells. Western blot analysis revealed an NEDD8 monomer and a series of higher molecular weight NEDD8-conjugated proteins or NEDD8 multimers. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that NEDD8 expression was highly enriched in the nucleus and was much weaker in the cytosol. In contrast, ubiquitin expression was detectable equally well in the nucleus and cytosol. Mutational analysis showed that the C terminus of NEDD8 was efficiently cleaved and that Gly-76 was required for conjugation of NEDD8 to other proteins. Taken together, NEDD8 provides another substrate for covalent protein modification and may play a unique role during development.},

They were con stricted with a fine ligature, which was left in situ, and examined at intervals up to 24h after operation. Immediately after tying the ligature there were definite changes in the morphology and organelle content of the axons adjacent to the constriction. These were due to the mechanical trauma produced by tying the ligature. From 10 min onwards there was a rapid accumulation of organelles in axons, which became progressively more swollen. Eventually the plasma membranes of both axons and Schwann cells broke down and later the Sclrwann cell basement membrane ruptured , allowing axonal organelles to escape into the interstitial spaces. The accumulating organelles included vesicles with an electron dense core, mitochondria, large vacuoles and myelin figures. Filamentous structures and both fine and wide tubules were more prominent and more numerous after operation. These were accompanied by a marked increase in the number of agranular vesicles. Tubular structures, morphologically similar to both the agranular vesicles and the vacuoles, were also very numerous. This similarity in appearance and the fact that many of these agranular vesicles, vacuoles and tubules were found joined together by either filaments or fine tubules suggests that they are part of the same system . At all times the greatest accumulation of organelles and the most marked axonal swelling was found in the first 0.5 to 1 mm segment of nerve immediately adjacent to the constriction. Less marked changes, affecting principally the agranular vesicles and finer tubules to gether with focal accumulations of mitochondria were seen at more proximal levels from 4h onwards. It is suggested that the axonal swelling is due to the accumulation of axoplasm and organelles. Two possible interpretations are discussed: (1) that this represents the effects of obstructing the normal flow of axoplasm from the cell body to the periphery, and (2) that some features, in particular the increase in the size and number of the various tubules may be indicative of an active reaction to the effects of axonal injury. These two phenomena probably take place simultaneously and are accompanied by degenerative changes.}

  abstract = {Background To establish and maintain their polarized morphology, neurons employ active transport driven by molecular motors to sort cargo between axons and dendrites. However, the basic traffic rules governing polarized transport on neuronal microtubule arrays are unclear. Results Here we show that the microtubule minus-end-directed motor dynein is required for the polarized targeting of dendrite-specific cargo, such as AMPA receptors. To directly examine how dynein motors contribute to polarized dendritic transport, we established a trafficking assay in hippocampal neurons to selectively probe specific motor protein activity. This revealed that, unlike kinesins, dynein motors drive cargo selectively into dendrites, governed by their mixed microtubule array. Moreover, axon-specific cargos, such as presynaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin, are redirected to dendrites by coupling to dynein motors. Quantitative modeling demonstrated that bidirectional dynein-driven transport on mixed microtubules provides an efficient mechanism to establish a stable density of continuously renewing vesicles in dendrites. Conclusions These results demonstrate a powerful approach to study specific motor protein activity inside living cells and imply a key role for dynein in dendritic transport. We propose that dynein establishes the initial sorting of dendritic cargo and additional motor proteins assist in subsequent delivery.},

  abstract = {A neuron has two types of highly polarized cell processes, the single axon and multiple dendrites. One of the fundamental questions of neurobiology is how neurons acquire such specific and polarized morphologies. During neuronal development, various actin-binding proteins regulate dynamics of actin cytoskeleton in the growth cones of developing axons. The regulation of actin cytoskeleton in the growth cones is thought to be involved in axon outgrowth and axon-dendrite specification. However, it is largely unknown which actin-binding proteins are involved in axon-dendrite specification and how they are transported into the developing axons. We have previously reported that collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2) plays a critical role in axon outgrowth and axon-dendrite specification (N. Inagaki, K. Chihara, N. Arimura, C. Menager, Y. Kawano, N. Matsuo, T. Nishimura, M. Amano, and K. Kaibuchi, Nat. Neurosci. 4:781-782, 2001). Here, we found that CRMP-2 interacted with the specifically Rac1-associated protein 1 (Sra-1)/WASP family verprolin-homologous protein 1 (WAVE1) complex, which is a regulator of actin cytoskeleton. The knockdown of Sra-1 and WAVE1 by RNA interference canceled CRMP-2-induced axon outgrowth and multiple-axon formation in cultured hippocampal neurons. We also found that CRMP-2 interacted with the light chain of kinesin-1 and linked kinesin-1 to the Sra-1/WAVE1 complex. The knockdown of CRMP-2 and kinesin-1 delocalized Sra-1 and WAVE1 from the growth cones of axons. These results suggest that CRMP-2 transports the Sra-1/WAVE1 complex to axons in a kinesin-1-dependent manner and thereby regulates axon outgrowth and formation.},

  abstract = {Kinesin motor proteins play a fundamental role for normal neuronal development by controlling intracellular cargo transport and microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton organization. Regulating kinesin activity is important to ensure their proper functioning, and their misregulation often leads to severe human neurological disorders. Homozygous nonsense mutations in kinesin-binding protein (KBP)/KIAA1279 cause the neurological disorder Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (GOSHS), which is characterized by intellectual disability, microcephaly, and axonal neuropathy. Here, we show that KBP regulates kinesin activity by interacting with the motor domains of a specific subset of kinesins to prevent their association with the MT cytoskeleton. The KBP-interacting kinesins include cargo-transporting motors such as kinesin-3/KIF1A and MT-depolymerizing motor kinesin-8/KIF18A. We found that KBP blocks KIF1A/UNC-104-mediated synaptic vesicle transport in cultured hippocampal neurons and in C. elegans PVD sensory neurons. In contrast, depletion of KBP results in the accumulation of KIF1A motors and synaptic vesicles in the axonal growth cone. We also show that KBP regulates neuronal MT dynamics by controlling KIF18A activity. Our data suggest that KBP functions as a kinesin inhibitor that modulates MT-based cargo motility and depolymerizing activity of a subset of kinesin motors. We propose that misregulation of KBP-controlled kinesin motors may represent the underlying molecular mechanism that contributes to the neuropathological defects observed in GOSHS patients.},

Quantitative analysis demonstrates that the spatial separation of a membrane-bound kinase and a cytosolic phosphatase potentially results in precipitous gradients of target phosphoproteins. Hypothetically, such gradients in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade would result in a strong attenuation of the phosphorylation signal towards the nucleus. When effective signal transduction is hampered by slow protein diffusion and rapid dephosphorylation, phosphoprotein trafficking within endocytic vesicles might be an efficient way to propagate the signals. Additional mechanisms facilitating information transfer could involve the assembly of MAP kinases on a scaffolding protein and active transport of signaling complexes by molecular motors. The proposed mechanism explains recent observations that MAPK activation can be strongly suppressed by various inhibitors of endocytosis.},

This has been difficult partly because of accessory polypeptide heterogeneity of dynein populations. The motor domain containing heavy chains of cytoplasmic dynein are associated with multiple intermediate, light intermediate, and light chain accessory polypeptides. We examined the organization of these subunits within cytoplasmic dynein by separating the molecule into two distinct subcomplexes. These subcomplexes were competent to reassemble into a molecule with dynein-like properties. One subcomplex was composed of the dynein heavy and light intermediate chains whereas the other subcomplex was composed of the intermediate and light chains. The intermediate and light chain subcomplex could be further separated into two pools, only one of which contained dynein light chains. The two pools had distinct intermediate chain compositions, suggesting that intermediate chain isoforms have different light chain\textendash binding properties. When the two intermediate chain pools were characterized by analytical velocity sedimentation, at least four molecular components were seen: intermediate chain monomers, intermediate chain dimers, intermediate chain monomers with bound light chains, and a mixture of intermediate chain dimers with assorted bound light chains. These data provide new insights into the compositional heterogeneity and assembly of the cytoplasmic dynein complex and suggest that individual dynein molecules have distinct molecular compositions in vivo.},

They form long, dynamic, rope-like structures within the cell that are essential for mitosis, maintenance of cell shape, and intracellular transport. More recently, in vitro studies have implicated microtubules as signaling molecules that, through changes in their stability, have the potential to trigger growth of axons and dendrites in developing neurons. In this study, we show that specific mutations in the Caenorhabditis elegans mec-7/{$\beta$}-tubulin gene cause ectopic axon formation in mechanosensory neurons in vivo. In mec-7 mutants, the ALM mechanosensory neuron forms a long ectopic neurite that extends posteriorly, a phenotype that can be mimicked in wild-type worms with a microtubule-stabilizing drug (paclitaxel), and suppressed by mutations in unc-33/CRMP2 and the kinesin-related gene, vab-8. Our results also reveal that these ectopic neurites contain RAB-3, a marker for presynaptic loci, suggesting that they have axon-like properties. Interestingly, in contrast with the excessive axonal growth observed during development, mec-7 mutants are inhibited in axonal regrowth and remodeling following axonal injury. Together our results suggest that MEC-7/{$\beta$}-tubulin integrity is necessary for the correct number of neurites a neuron generates in vivo and for the capacity of an axon to regenerate.}

We report the characterization of an Arf-like small G protein, ARL-8, required during this process. arl-8 mutants prematurely accumulate presynaptic cargoes within the proximal axon of several neuronal classes, with a corresponding failure to assemble presynapses distally. This proximal accumulation requires the activity of several molecules known to catalyze presynaptic assembly.

  abstract = {We discuss a theoretical model for bidirectional cargo transport in biological cells, which is driven by teams of molecular motors and subject to thermal fluctuations. The model describes explicitly the directed motion of the molecular motors on the filament. The motor-cargo coupling is implemented via linear springs. By means of extensive Monte Carlo simulations we show that the model describes the experimentally observed regimes of anomalous diffusion, i.e. subdiffusive behavior at short times followed by superdiffusion at intermediate times. The model results indicate that the subdiffusive regime is induced by thermal fluctuations while the superdiffusive motion is generated by correlations of the motors' activity. We also tested the efficiency of bidirectional cargo transport in crowded areas by measuring its ability to pass barriers with increased viscosity. Our results show a remarkable gain of efficiency for high viscosities.},

Recently, there has been a resurgence in research directed at understanding the intricate regulation of microtubule dynamics and organization during mitosis. This comes in part from the identification of new proteins involved in microtubule regulation as well as advances in fluorescence imaging that allow visualization of mitotic processes that previously have never been observed.},

Previous in vitro studies have shown that a Dictyostelium relative of UNC-104 transports liposomes containing acidic phospholipids, but whether this interaction is needed for the recognition and transport of synaptic vesicles in metazoans remains unexplored. Here, we have introduced mutations in the nonmotor domain of UNC-104 and examined whether these mutant motors can rescue an unc-104 Caenorhabditis elegans strain. We show that a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in UNC-104 is essential for membrane transport in living C. elegans, that this PH domain binds specifically to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), and that point mutants in the PH domain that interfere with PI(4,5)P2 binding in vitro also interfere with UNC-104 function in vivo. Several other lipid-binding modules could not effectively substitute for the UNC-104 PH domain in this in vivo assay. Real time imaging also revealed that a lipid-binding point mutation in the PH domain reduced movement velocity and processivity of individual UNC-104::GFP punctae in neurites. These results reveal a critical role for PI(4,5)P2 binding in UNC-104\textendash mediated axonal transport and shows that the cargo-binding properties of the distal PH domain can affect motor output.},

  abstract = {The transport of cargo particles that are pulled by several molecular motors in a cooperative manner is studied theoretically in this article. The transport properties depend primarily on the maximal number N of motor molecules that may pull simultaneously on the cargo particle. Because each motor must unbind from the filament after a finite number of steps but can also rebind to it again, the actual number of pulling motors is not constant but varies with time between zero and N. An increase in the maximal number N leads to a strong increase of the average walking distance (or run length) of the cargo particle. If the cargo is pulled by up to N kinesin motors, for example, the walking distance is estimated to be 5(N-1)/N micrometers, which implies that seven or eight kinesin molecules are sufficient to attain an average walking distance in the centimeter range. If the cargo particle is pulled against an external load force, this force is shared between the motors, which provides a nontrivial motor-motor coupling and a generic mechanism for nonlinear force-velocity relationships. With increasing load force, the probability distribution of the instantaneous velocity is shifted toward smaller values, becomes broader, and develops several peaks. Our theory is consistent with available experimental data and makes quantitative predictions that are accessible to systematic in vitro experiments.},

The machinery appears to be largely localized in the cortical zone of the axon, where, in vertebrate axons, it is distributed longitudinally as intermittent, discrete domains, called periaxoplasmic plaques. Studies, based on translation assays and probes of RNA transcripts in axon models such as the squid giant axon and selected vertebrate axons, provide evidence of locally synthesized proteins, most of which appear to be constituents of the slow axoplasmic transport rate groups. Metabolic and molecular biological findings are consistent with the view that the synthesis of proteins undergoing local turnover in the axonal compartment of macroneurons depends on the activity of an endogenous translational machinery. The documented presence of a metabolically active machinery in presynaptic terminals of squid photoreceptor neurons is also described. Finally, potential sources of axoplasmic RNAs comprising the machinery, which may include the ensheathing cell of the axon, as well as the cognate cell body, are also discussed.},

A kinesin molecule was adsorbed onto a latex bead, which was captured by an optical trap and brought into contact with an axoneme that was bound to a glass surface. The displacement of kinesin during force generation was determined by measuring the position of the beads with nanometer accuracy. As the displacement of kinesin was attenuated because of the compliance of the kinesin-to-bead and kinesin-to-microtubule linkages, the compliance was monitored during force generation and was used to correct the displacement of kinesin. Thus the velocity and the unitary steps could be obtained accurately over a wide force range. The force-velocity curves were linear from 0 to a maximum force at 10 microM and 1 mM ATP, and the maximum force was approximately 7 pN, which is larger by approximately 30\% than values previously reported. Kinesin exhibited forward and occasionally backward stepwise displacements with a size of approximately 8 nm. The histograms of step dwell time show a monotonic decrease with time. Model calculations indicate that each kinesin head steps by 16-nm, whereas kinesin molecule steps by 8-nm.},

These UBLs are covalently linked to most, if not all, target protein(s) through an enzymatic cascade analogous to ubiquitylation, consisting of E1 (activating), E2 (conjugating), and E3 (ligating) enzymes. In this report, we describe the identification of a novel ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (Ufm1) with a molecular mass of 9.1 kDa, displaying apparently similar tertiary structure, although lacking obvious sequence identity, to ubiquitin. Ufm1 is first cleaved at the C-terminus to expose its conserved Gly residue. This Gly residue is essential for its subsequent conjugating reactions. The C-terminally processed Ufm1 is activated by a novel E1-like enzyme, Uba5, by forming a high-energy thioester bond. Activated Ufm1 is then transferred to its cognate E2-like enzyme, Ufc1, in a similar thioester linkage. Ufm1 forms several complexes in HEK293 cells and mouse tissues, revealing that it conjugates to the target proteins. Ufm1, Uba5, and Ufc1 are all conserved in metazoa and plants but not in yeast, suggesting its potential roles in various multicellular organisms.},

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in enrichment-induced neuronal changes; however, the precise mechanism underlying these effects remains uncertain. In this study, a specific upregulation of kinesin superfamily motor protein 1A (KIF1A) was observed in the hippocampi of mice kept in an enriched environment and, in hippocampal neurons in~vitro, BDNF increased the levels of KIF1A and of KIF1A-mediated cargo transport. Analysis of Bdnf+/- and Kif1a+/- mice revealed that a lack of KIF1A upregulation resulted in a loss of enrichment-induced hippocampal synaptogenesis and learning enhancement. Meanwhile, KIF1A overexpression promoted synaptogenesis via the formation of presynaptic boutons. These findings demonstrate that KIF1A is indispensable for BDNF-mediated hippocampal synaptogenesis and learning enhancement induced by enrichment.

Analysis of Kif6 mutant mice with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and immunofluorescence (IF) revealed specific defects in the formation of EC cilia, without obvious effect of cilia of other multiciliated tissues. Dilation of the ventricular system and defects in the formation of EC cilia were also observed in adult kif6 mutant zebrafish.

However, loss of spectrin results in only mild and occasional defects in synaptobrevin localization. Thus, the dynein-dynactin complex shows neuronal cargo selectivity without spectrin being a critical component of cargo binding. We observed parallels to progressive motor neuron disease symptoms in these animals. With age, neuronal misaccumulations increase in size and frequency; locomotion becomes progressively slower; and life span is shortened. These mutants provide a model to assess whether defects in transport of specific cargo mediate neuronal dysfunction.},

A role for FLA10 in submembranous or flagellar surface motility is also strongly supported by the immunolocalization of FLA10 to the region between the axonemal outer doublet microtubules and the flagellar membrane.},

  abstract = {The regulation of AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) membrane trafficking is a key mechanism by which neurons regulate synaptic strength and plasticity. AMPAR trafficking is modulated through a combination of receptor phosphorylation, ubiquitination, endocytosis, and recycling, yet the factors that mediate these processes are just beginning to be uncovered. Here we identify the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant UEV-1 as a regulator of AMPAR trafficking in vivo. We identified mutations in uev-1 in a genetic screen for mutants with altered trafficking of the AMPAR subunit GLR-1 in C. elegans interneurons. Loss of uev-1 activity results in the accumulation of GLR-1 in elongated accretions in neuron cell bodies and along the ventral cord neurites. Mutants also have a corresponding behavioral defect\textemdash a decrease in spontaneous reversals in locomotion\textemdash consistent with diminished GLR-1 function. The localization of other synaptic proteins in uev-1-mutant interneurons appears normal, indicating that the GLR-1 trafficking defects are not due to gross deficiencies in synapse formation or overall protein trafficking. We provide evidence that GLR-1 accumulates at RAB-10-containing endosomes in uev-1 mutants, and that receptors arrive at these endosomes independent of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. UEV-1 homologs in other species bind to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc13 to create K63-linked polyubiquitin chains on substrate proteins. We find that whereas UEV-1 can interact with C. elegans UBC-13, global levels of K63-linked ubiquitination throughout nematodes appear to be unaffected in uev-1 mutants, even though UEV-1 is broadly expressed in most tissues. Nevertheless, ubc-13 mutants are similar in phenotype to uev-1 mutants, suggesting that the two proteins do work together to regulate GLR-1 trafficking. Our results suggest that UEV-1 could regulate a small subset of K63-linked ubiquitination events in nematodes, at least one of which is critical in regulating GLR-1 trafficking.},

The E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme lies at the apex of the ubiquitination cascade, and its activity is necessary for all subsequent steps in the reaction. We have isolated a temperature-sensitive mutation in the Caenorhabditis elegans uba-1 gene, which encodes the sole E1 enzyme in this organism. Manipulation of UBA-1 activity at different developmental stages reveals a variety of functions for ubiquitination, including novel roles in sperm fertility, control of body size, and sex-specific development. Levels of ubiquitin conjugates are substantially reduced in the mutant, consistent with reduced E1 activity. The uba-1 mutation causes delays in meiotic progression in the early embryo, a process that is known to be regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. The uba-1 mutation also demonstrates synthetic lethal interactions with alleles of the anaphase-promoting complex, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The uba-1 mutation provides a sensitized genetic background for identifying new in vivo functions for downstream components of the ubiquitin enzyme cascade, and it is one of the first conditional mutations reported for the essential E1 enzyme in a metazoan animal model.},

Our study shows that UNC-16, a Caenorhabditis\hspace{0.6em}elegans JIP3 homolog, inhibits axonal regeneration by regulating initiation and rate of regrowth. This occurs through the inhibition of the regeneration-promoting activity of the long isoform of DLK-1 and independently of the inhibitory short isoform of DLK-1. We show that UNC-16 promotes DLK-1 punctate localization in a concentration-dependent manner limiting the availability of the long isoform of DLK-1 at the cut site, minutes after injury. UNC-16 negatively regulates actin dynamics through DLK-1 and microtubule dynamics partially via DLK-1. We show that post-injury cytoskeletal dynamics in unc-16 mutants are also partially dependent on CEBP-1. The faster regeneration seen in unc-16 mutants does not lead to functional recovery. Our data suggest that the inhibitory control by UNC-16 and the short isoform of DLK-1 balances the intrinsic growth-promoting function of the long isoform of DLK-1 in vivo. We propose a model where UNC-16's inhibitory role in regeneration occurs through both a tight temporal and spatial control of DLK-1 and cytoskeletal dynamics.},

Common features have also been described for motor proteins and G proteins. Despite these similarities, the evolutionary relationships between these proteins, even among the motor proteins, has not been obvious, since the topological connectivities of the core overlapping structural elements in these transducing proteins are not identical to one another. Using secondary structure topology, comparison of functional domains and active site chemistry as criteria for relatedness, we propose a set of rules for determining potential evolutionary relationships between proteins showing little or no sequence identity. These rules were used to explore the evolutionary relationship between kinesin and myosin, as well as between motor proteins and other phosphate-loop (P-loop) containing nucleotide- binding proteins. We demonstrate that kinesin and myosin show significant chemical conservations within and outside of the active site, and present an evolutionary scheme that produces their respective topologies from a hypothetical ancestral protein. We also show that, when compared with various other P-loop-containing proteins, the cytoskeletal motors are most similar to G proteins with respect to topology and active site chemistry. We conclude that kinesin and myosin, and possibly G proteins, are probably directly related via divergent evolution from a common core nucleotide-binding motif, and describe the likely topology of this ancestor. These proteins use similar chemical and physical mechanisms to both sense the state of the nucleotide bound in the active site, and then transmit these changes to protein partners. The different topologies can be accounted for by unique genetic insertions that add to the edge of a progenitor protein structure and do not disrupt the hydrophobic core.},

The fate of the motor upon reaching the synapse is not known. We found that wild-type UNC-104 is degraded at synaptic regions through the ubiquitin pathway and is not retrogradely transported back to the cell body. As a possible means to regulate the motor, we tested the effect of cargo binding on UNC-104 levels. The unc-104(e1265) allele carries a point mutation (D1497N) in the PI(4,5)P(2) binding pocket of the PH domain, resulting in greatly reduced preferential binding to PI(4,5)P(2)in vitro and presence of very few motors on pre-synaptic vesicles in vivo. unc-104(e1265) animals have poor locomotion irrespective of in vivo PI(4,5)P(2) levels due to reduced anterograde transport. Moreover, they show highly reduced levels of UNC-104 in vivo. To confirm that loss of cargo binding specificity reduces motor levels, we isolated two intragenic suppressors with compensatory mutations within the PH domain. These show partial restoration of in vitro preferential PI(4,5)P(2) binding and presence of more motors on pre-synaptic vesicles in vivo. These animals show improved locomotion dependent on in vivo PI(4,5)P(2) levels, increased anterograde transport, and partial restoration of UNC-104 protein levels in vivo. For further proof, we mutated a conserved residue in one suppressor background. The PH domain in this triple mutant lacked in vitro PI(4,5)P(2) binding specificity, and the animals again showed locomotory defects and reduced motor levels. All allelic variants show increased UNC-104 levels upon blocking the ubiquitin pathway. These data show that inability to bind cargo can target motors for degradation. In view of the observed degradation of the motor in synaptic regions, this further suggests that UNC-104 may get degraded at synapses upon release of cargo.},

  abstract = {Triglyceride-rich lipid droplets (LDs) are catabolized with high efficiency in hepatocytes to supply fatty acids for producing lipoprotein particles. Fasting causes a massive influx of adipose-derived fatty acids into the liver. The liver in the fasted state is therefore bloated with LDs but, remarkably, still continues to secrete triglycerides at a constant rate. Here we show that insulin signaling elevates phosphatidic acid (PA) dramatically on LDs in the fed state. PA then signals to recruit kinesin-1 motors, which transport LDs to the peripherally located smooth ER inside hepatocytes, where LDs are catabolized to produce lipoproteins. This pathway is down-regulated homeostatically when fasting causes insulin levels to drop, thus preventing dangerous elevation of triglycerides in the blood. Further, we show that a specific peptide against kinesin-1 blocks triglyceride secretion without any apparent deleterious effects on cells. Our work therefore reveals fundamental mechanisms that maintain lipid homeostasis across metabolic states and leverages this knowledge to propose a molecular target against hyperlipidemia.}

Stationary clusters of such vesicles are a prominent feature of axonal transport, but little is known about their physiological and functional relevance. Here, we develop a simulation model describing key features of axonal cargo transport with a view to addressing this question, benchmarking the model against our experiments in the touch neurons of C. elegans. Our simulations provide for multiple microtubule tracks and varied cargo motion states while also incorporating cargo-cargo interactions. Our model also incorporates obstacles to vesicle transport in the form of microtubule ends, stalled vesicles, and stationary mitochondria. We devise computational methodologies to simulate both axonal bleaching and axotomy, showing that our results reproduce the properties of both moving as well as stationary cargo in vivo. Increasing vesicle numbers leads to larger and more long-lived stationary clusters of vesicular cargo. Vesicle clusters are dynamically stable, explaining why they are ubiquitously seen. Modulating the rates of cargo motion-state switching allows cluster lifetimes and flux to be tuned both in simulations and experiments. We demonstrate, both in simulations and in an experimental system, that suppressing reversals leads to larger stationary vesicle clusters being formed while also reducing flux. Our simulation results support the view that the physiological significance of clusters is located in their role as dynamic reservoirs of cargo vesicles, capable of being released or sequestered on demand.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.}

Although we understand single motors experimentally and theoretically, our understanding of multiple motors working together is less developed.|We theoretically investigate how multiple kinesin motors function. Our model includes stochastic fluctuations of each motor as it proceeds through its enzymatic cycle. Motors dynamically influence each other and function in the presence of thermal noise and viscosity. We test the theory via comparison with the experimentally observed distribution of step sizes for two motors moving a cargo, and by predicting slightly subadditive stalling force for two motors relative to one. In the presence of load, our predictions for travel distances and mean velocities are different from the steady-state model: with high motor-motor coupling, we predict a form of strain-gating, where-because of the underlying motor's dynamics-the motors share load unevenly, leading to increased mean travel distance of the multiple-motor system under load. Surprisingly, we predict that in the presence of small load, two-motor cargoes move slightly slower than do single-motor cargoes. Unpublished data from G.T. Shubeita, B.C. Carter, and S.P.G. confirm this prediction in vivo.|When only a few motors are active, fluctuations and unequal load sharing between motors can result in significant alterations of ensemble function.},

Often, multiple kinesin or dynein motors move the same cargo. Their collective function depends critically on the single motors' detachment kinetics under load, which we experimentally measure here. This experimental constraint--combined with other experimentally determined parameters--is then incorporated into theoretical stochastic and mean-field models. Comparison of modeling results and in vitro data shows good agreement for the stochastic, but not mean-field, model. Many cargos in vivo move bidirectionally, frequently reversing course. Because both kinesin and dynein are present on the cargos, one popular hypothesis explaining the frequent reversals is that the opposite-polarity motors engage in unregulated stochastic tugs-of-war. Then, the cargos' motion can be explained entirely by the outcome of these opposite-motor competitions. Here, we use fully calibrated stochastic and mean-field models to test the tug-of-war hypothesis. Neither model agrees well with our in vivo data, suggesting that, in addition to inevitable tugs-of-war between opposite motors, there is an additional level of regulation not included in the models.},

This requires transport of these cargos from the soma to the presynaptic terminal or other active sites in the axon. Axons utilize both bidirectional (for example, slow axonal transport) and unidirectional (for example, fast anterograde axonal transport) modes of cargo transport. Bidirectional transport seems to be less efficient because it requires more time and takes more energy to deliver cargos. In this paper, we studied a family of models which differ by the modes of axonal cargo transport (such as anterograde and retrograde motor-driven transport and passive diffusion) as well as by the presence or absence of pausing states. The models are studied to investigate their ability to describe axonal transport against the cargo concentration gradient. We argue that bidirectional axonal transport is described by a higher-order mathematical model, which allows imposing cargo concentration not only at the axon hillock but also at the axon terminal. The unidirectional transport model allows only for the imposition of cargo concentration at the axon hillock. Due to the great lengths of the axons, anterograde transport mostly relies on molecular motors, such as kinesins, to deliver cargos synthesized in the soma to the terminal and other active sites in the axon. Retrograde transport can be also motor-driven, in which case cargos are transported by dynein motors. If cargo concentration at the axon tip is higher than at the axon hillock, retrograde transport can also occur by cargo diffusion. However, because many axonal cargos are large or they assemble in multiprotein complexes for axonal transport, the diffusivity of such cargos is very small. We investigated the case of a small cargo diffusivity using a perturbation technique and found that for this case the effect of diffusion is limited to a very thin diffusion boundary layer near the axon tip. If cargo diffusivity is decreased in the model, we show that without motor-driven retrograde transport the model is unable to describe a high cargo concentration at the axon tip. To the best of our knowledge, our paper presents the first explanation for the utilization of seemingly inefficient bidirectional transport in neurons.},

  abstract = {Recent publications report that although the mitochondria population in an axon can be quickly replaced by a combination of retrograde and anterograde axonal transport (often within less than 24 hours), the axon contains much older mitochondria. This suggests that not all mitochondria that reach the soma are degraded and that some are recirculating back into the axon. To explain this, we developed a model that simulates mitochondria distribution when a portion of mitochondria that return to the soma are redirected back to the axon rather than being destroyed in somatic lysosomes. Utilizing the developed model, we studied how the percentage of returning mitochondria affects the mean age and age density distributions of mitochondria at different distances from the soma. We also investigated whether turning off the mitochondrial anchoring switch can reduce the mean age of mitochondria. For this purpose, we studied the effect of reducing the value of a parameter that characterizes the probability of mitochondria transition to the stationary (anchored) state. The reduction in mitochondria mean age observed when the anchoring probability is reduced suggests that some injured neurons may be saved if the percentage of stationary mitochondria is decreased. The replacement of possibly damaged stationary mitochondria with newly synthesized ones may restore the energy supply in an injured axon. We also performed a sensitivity study of the mean age of stationary mitochondria to the parameter that determines what portion of mitochondria re-enter the axon and the parameter that determines the probability of mitochondria transition to the stationary state.},

KIF21B is a neuronal kinesin that is highly enriched in dendrites. The regulation and specificity of microtubule transport involves the binding of motors to individual cargo adapters and accessory proteins. Moreover, posttranslational modifications of either the motor protein, their cargos or tubulin regulate motility, cargo recognition and the binding or unloading of cargos. Here we show that the ubiquitin E3 ligase TRIM3, also known as BERP, interacts with KIF21B via its RBCC domain. TRIM3 is found at intracellular and Golgi-derived vesicles and co-localizes with the KIF21B motor in neurons. Trim3 gene deletion in mice and TRIM3 overexpression in cultured neurons both suggested that the E3-ligase function of TRIM3 is not involved in KIF21B degradation, however TRIM3 depletion reduces the motility of the motor. Together, our data suggest that TRIM3 is a regulator in the modulation of KIF21B motor function.},

Ubiquitin (Ub) conjugation is a general targeting modification and poly-ubiquitin chains specifically target proteins to the proteasome for degradation. In this report, we show that the multistep cascade of mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination can be reduced to three purified recombinant proteins: ubiquitin-conjugated E2, mdm2, and p53. This simplification allows enzymatic analysis of the isolated ligase reaction. The simplified reaction recapitulates the ubiquitination of p53 observed with individual components and the p53-Ub\textsubscript{(n)} is qualitatively similar to p53-Ub\textsubscript{(n)}detected in lactacystin-treated cells. Surprisingly, we find that p53 is modified with multiple mono-ubiquitin moieties as opposed to a poly-ubiquitin chain. Finally, kinetic analysis indicates the transfer reaction proceeds either through a modified Ping Pong mechanism involving requisite enzyme isomerization steps, or through a Rapid Equilibrium Random Bi Bi mechanism involving very large anti-cooperative interactions between the two substrate binding pockets on the enzyme, mediated through allosteric changes in enzyme structure.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The absence of ribosomal RNA in the axoplasm [Lasek, R. J. et al.

Approximately 50\% of the newly synthesized Schwann cell proteins are transferred to the giant axon. These transferred proteins are soluble for the most part and range in molecular size from 12,000 to greater than 200,000 daltons. It is suggested that proteins transferred from the Schwann cell to the axon have a regulatory role in neuronal function.}

However, the relative importance of this modification versus monoubiquitylation in endocytosis, Golgi to endosome traffic, and sorting into the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway remains unclear. In this study, we show that K63-linked ubiquitylation of the Gap1 permease is essential for its entry into the MVB pathway. Carboxypeptidase S also requires modification with a K63-Ub chain for correct MVB sorting. In contrast, monoubiquitylation of a single target lysine of Gap1 is a sufficient signal for its internalization from the cell surface, and Golgi to endosome transport of the permease requires neither its ubiquitylation nor the Ub-binding GAT (Gga and Tom1) domain of Gga (Golgi localizing, gamma-ear containing, ARF binding) adapter proteins, the latter being crucial for subsequent MVB sorting of the permease. Our data reveal that K63-linked Ub chains act as a specific signal for MVB sorting, providing further insight into the Ub code of membrane protein trafficking.}

We hypothesize that motor proteins may be adapted to operate in crowded environments by having molecular properties that prevent them from forming traffic jams. To test this hypothesis, we reconstituted high-density traffic of purified kinesin-8 motor protein, a highly processive motor with long end-residency time, along microtubules in a total internal-reflection fluorescence microscopy assay. We found that traffic jams, characterized by an abrupt increase in the density of motors with an associated abrupt decrease in motor speed, form even in the absence of other obstructing proteins. To determine the molecular properties that lead to jamming, we altered the concentration of motors, their processivity, and their rate of dissociation from microtubule ends. Traffic jams occurred when the motor density exceeded a critical value (density-induced jams) or when motor dissociation from the microtubule ends was so slow that it resulted in a pileup (bottleneck-induced jams). Through comparison of our experimental results with theoretical models and stochastic simulations, we characterized in detail under which conditions density- and bottleneck-induced traffic jams form or do not form. Our results indicate that transport kinesins, such as kinesin-1, may be evolutionarily adapted to avoid the formation of traffic jams by moving only with moderate processivity and dissociating rapidly from microtubule ends.}

Here, we report an intramolecular interaction in KIF1A between the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain and a coiled-coil domain (CC2) immediately following the FHA domain. Disrupting this interaction by point mutations in the FHA or CC2 domains leads to a dramatic accumulation of KIF1A in the periphery of living cultured neurons and an enhancement of the microtubule (MT) binding and self-multimerization of KIF1A. In addition, point mutations causing rigidity in the predicted flexible hinge disrupt the intramolecular FHA-CC2 interaction and increase MT binding and peripheral accumulation of KIF1A. These results suggest that the intramolecular FHA-CC2 interaction negatively regulates KIF1A activity by inhibiting MT binding and dimerization of KIF1A, and point to a novel role of the FHA domain in the regulation of kinesin motors.},

Growth cones are actin-enriched structures that regulate axon extension rate and direction. During neuronal development, increasing actin dynamics in the growth cone through the regulation of the activity of specific actin-binding proteins leads to increased axon elongation. Here, we will focus on recent findings showing that enhanced axon regeneration in the adult nervous system can be achieved by promoting actin dynamics, or by decreasing actomyosin contraction in the growth cone.

Furthermore, biologically active GFP-dynein travels on endosomes in retrograde and not in anterograde direction. Surprisingly, a CLIP170 homologue was neither needed for dynein localization nor for endosome transport.

KIF1A cargo is mislocalized in many neurodegenerative diseases, indicating that KIF1A's highly efficient, superprocessive motility along axonal microtubules needs to be tightly regulated. One potential regulatory mechanism may be through posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of axonal microtubules. These PTMs often occur on the C-terminal tails of the microtubule tracks, act as molecular ``traffic signals'' helping to direct kinesin motor cargo delivery, and include C-terminal tail polyglutamylation important for KIF1A cargo transport. KIF1A initially interacts with microtubule C-terminal tails through its K-loop, a positively charged surface loop of the KIF1A motor domain. However, the role of the K-loop in KIF1A motility and response to perturbations in C-terminal tail polyglutamylation is underexplored. Using single-molecule imaging, we present evidence that KIF1A pauses on different microtubule lattice structures, linking multiple processive segments together and contributing to KIF1A's characteristic superprocessive run length. Furthermore, modifications of the KIF1A K-loop or tubulin C-terminal tail polyglutamylation reduced KIF1A pausing and overall run length. These results suggest a new mechanism to regulate KIF1A motility via pauses mediated by K-loop/polyglutamylated C-terminal tail interactions, providing further insight into KIF1A's role in axonal transport.},

Netrin-1 induces the movement of Vg1RBP granules into filopodia, suggesting that it may direct the localization and translation of mRNAs in growth cones. Indeed, a gradient of netrin-1 activates a translation initiation regulator, eIF-4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP), asymmetrically and triggers a polarized increase in {$\beta$}-actin translation on the near side of the growth cone before growth cone turning. Inhibition of {$\beta$}-actin translation abolishes both the asymmetric rise in {$\beta$}-actin and attractive, but not repulsive, turning.

H2-IR was widely present in peripheral nervous system and virtually colocalized with synaptic vesicle proteins synaptophysin, synaptobrevin I, and SNAP-25 and two neuropeptides [calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP)], although H2-IR was weaker in spinal cord terminals. In contrast, H1-IR appeared preferentially enriched in large axons, probably motor and large sensory neurons, which contained synaptophysin-IR, synaptobrevin I-IR, SNAP-25-IR, and CGRP-IR. However, H1-IR was weak or absent from SP-containing thin and medium-sized axons. In addition, H1-IR appeared to be absent from spinal cord nerve terminals. H1- and H2-IR kinesins are both transported with fast axonal transport, and comparatively small amounts of kinesins are retrogradely transported. H2 was widely distributed in motor, sensory, and sympathetic neurons, whereas H1 was enriched in large motor and sensory neurons. J. Neurosci.

How axonal and dendritic proteins are sorted and targeted to different compartments is poorly understood. Here, we identified distinct dileucine motifs that are necessary and sufficient to target transmembrane proteins to either the axon or the dendrite through direct interactions with the clathrin-associated adaptor protein complexes (APs) in C.~elegans. Axonal targeting requires AP-3, while dendritic targeting is mediated by AP-1. The axonal dileucine motif binds to AP-3 with higher efficiency than to AP-1. Both AP-3 and AP-1 are localized to the Golgi but occupy adjacent domains. We propose that AP-3 and AP-1 directly select transmembrane proteins and target them to axon and dendrite, respectively, by sorting them into distinct vesicle pools.},

Moreover, the rate of IFT entry is dynamically regulated during cilium assembly. However, the regulatory mechanism of IFT entry and loading/unloading of IFT particles remains elusive. We show that the kinesin-II motor subunit FLA8, a homolog of KIF3B, is phosphorylated on the conserved S663 by a calcium-dependent kinase in Chlamydomonas. This phosphorylation disrupts the interaction between kinesin-II and IFT-B, inactivates kinesin-II and inhibits IFT entry, and is also required for IFT-B unloading at the ciliary tip. Furthermore, our data suggest that the IFT entry rate is controlled by regulation of the cellular level of phosphorylated FLA8.

We have identified Khc-73, a plus-end directed microtubule motor protein, as a regulator of sorting of endosomes in Drosophila larval motor neurons. The number of synaptic boutons and the amount of neurotransmitter release at the Khc-73 mutant larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) are normal, but we find a significant decrease in the number of presynaptic release sites. This defect in Khc-73 mutant larvae can be genetically enhanced by a partial genetic loss of Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) signaling or suppressed by activation of BMP signaling in motoneurons. Consistently, activation of BMP signaling that normally enhances the accumulation of phosphorylated form of BMP transcription factor Mad in the nuclei, can be suppressed by genetic removal of Khc-73. Using a number of assays including live imaging in larval motor neurons, we show that loss of Khc-73 curbs the ability of retrograde-bound endosomes to leave the synaptic area and join the retrograde axonal pathway. Our findings identify Khc-73 as a regulator of endosomal traffic at the synapse and modulator of retrograde BMP signaling in motoneurons.},

Here, we present a mechanism for RNA transport in which RNA granules ``hitchhike'' on moving lysosomes. In~vitro biophysical modeling, live-cell microscopy, and unbiased proximity labeling proteomics reveal that annexin A11 (ANXA11), an RNA granule-associated phosphoinositide-binding protein, acts as a molecular tether between RNA granules and lysosomes. ANXA11 possesses an N-terminal low complexity domain, facilitating its phase separation into membraneless RNA granules, and a C-terminal membrane binding domain, enabling interactions with lysosomes. RNA granule transport requires ANXA11, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-associated mutations in ANXA11 impair RNA granule transport by disrupting their interactions with lysosomes. Thus, ANXA11 mediates neuronal RNA transport by tethering RNA granules to actively-transported lysosomes, performing a critical cellular function that is disrupted in ALS.},

  abstract = {Motor-dependent anterograde transport, a process that moves cytoplasmic components from sites of biosynthesis to sites of use within cells, is crucial in neurons with long axons. Evidence has emerged that multiple anterograde kinesins can contribute to some transport processes. To test the multi-kinesin possibility for a single vesicle type, we studied the functional relationships of axonal kinesins to dense core vesicles (DCVs) that were filled with a GFP-tagged neuropeptide in the Drosophila nervous system. Past work showed that Unc-104 (a kinesin-3) is a key anterograde DCV motor. Here we show that anterograde DCV transport requires the well-known mitochondrial motor Khc (kinesin-1). Our results indicate that this influence is direct. Khc mutations had specific effects on anterograde run parameters, neuron-specific inhibition of mitochondrial transport by Milton RNA interference had no influence on anterograde DCV runs, and detailed colocalization analysis by superresolution microscopy revealed that Unc-104 and Khc coassociate with individual DCVs. DCV distribution analysis in peptidergic neurons suggest the two kinesins have compartment specific influences. We suggest a mechanism in which Unc-104 is particularly important for moving DCVs from cell bodies into axons, and then Unc-104 and kinesin-1 function together to support fast, highly processive runs toward axon terminals.}

Alterations in AMPAR localization and turnover have been considered critical mechanisms underpinning synaptic plasticity and higher brain functions, but the molecular processes that control AMPAR trafficking and stability are still not fully understood. Here, we report that mammalian AMPARs are subject to ubiquitination in neurons and in transfected heterologous cells. Ubiquitination facilitates AMPAR endocytosis, leading to a reduction in AMPAR cell-surface localization and total receptor abundance. Mutation of lysine residues to arginine residues at the glutamate receptor subunit 1 (GluA1) C-terminus dramatically reduces GluA1 ubiquitination and abolishes ubiquitin-dependent GluA1 internalization and degradation, indicating that the lysine residues, particularly K868, are sites of ubiquitination. We also find that the E3 ligase neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4 (Nedd4) is enriched in synaptosomes and co-localizes and associates with AMPARs in neurons. Nedd4 expression leads to AMPAR ubiquitination, leading to reduced AMPAR surface expression and suppressed excitatory synaptic transmission. Conversely, knockdown of Nedd4 by specific siRNAs abolishes AMPAR ubiquitination. These data indicate that Nedd4 is the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for AMPAR ubiquitination, a modification that regulates multiple aspects of AMPAR molecular biology including trafficking, localization and stability.},

Apart from the cell loss in the injury core, cell death in regions surrounding the injury core may also contribute to significant losses in neurological functions. In fact, it is the injured neurons in these regions around the injury core that treatments are targeting to preserve. In this review, we present our cumulated understanding of stress-activated signaling pathways and apoptotic pathways in the research areas of ischemic injury, TBI and epilepsy and that gathered from concerted research efforts in oncology and other diseases. However, it is obvious that our understanding of these pathways in the context of acute brain injury is at its infancy stage and merits further investigation. Hopefully, this added research effort will provide a more detailed knowledge from which better therapeutic strategies can be developed to treat these acute brain injuries.},

It is currently unclear whether interactions between kinesin motors and microtubule-binding proteins can steer polarized transport. By screening all 45 kinesin family members, we systematically addressed which kinesin motors can translocate cargo in living cells and drive polarized transport in hippocampal neurons. While the majority of kinesin motors transport cargo selectively into axons, we identified five members of the kinesin-3 (KIF1) and kinesin-4 (KIF21) subfamily that can also target dendrites. We found that microtubule-binding protein doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) labels a subset of dendritic microtubules and is required for KIF1-dependent dense-core vesicles (DCVs) trafficking into dendrites and dendrite development. Our study demonstrates that microtubule-binding proteins can provide local signals for specific kinesin motors to drive polarized cargo transport.},

These motors are rather small and have a size of 20\textendash 100nm but are able to pull vesicles, organelles and other types of cargo over large distances, from micrometers up to meters. There are several families of motors: kinesins, dyneins, and myosins. Most of these motors have two heads which are used as legs and perform discrete steps along the filaments. Several aspects of the motor behavior will be discussed: motor cycles of two-headed motors; walks of single motors or cargo particles which consist of directed movements interrupted by random, diffusive motion; cargo transport through tube-like compartments; active diffusion of cargo particles in slab-like compartments; cooperative transport of cargo by several motors which may be uni- or bi-directional; and systems with many interacting motors that exhibit traffic jams, self-organized density and flux patterns, and traffic phase transitions far from equilibrium. It is necessary to understand these traffic phenomena in a quantitative manner in order to construct and optimize biomimetic transport systems based on motors and filaments with many possible applications in bioengineering, pharmacology, and medicine.},

Cytoplasmic p53 is shown to promote apoptosis and inhibit the induction of autophagy. In this study we show that NEDD8 ultimate buster 1 (NUB1), a non-covalent interactor of the Ubl NEDD8 (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 8), controls the localization of p53. Expression of NUB1 leads to decreased modification of p53 with NEDD8 and stimulation of p53 ubiquitination. The biological outcome is the cytoplasmic localization and inhibition of the transcriptional activity of p53. Although the effects of NUB1 on p53 depend on NEDDylation and the murine double minute 2 (Mdm2) E3-ligase, the cooperation of NEDD8 with ubiquitin is required. The data identify a role for NEDD8 in controlling p53 localization and suggest that NEDD8 can control protein function through its non-covalent recognition by interacting proteins.},

We show that the conserved proteasome-binding protein PI31 serves as an adaptor to couple proteasomes with dynein light chain proteins (DYNLL1/2). The inactivation of PI31 inhibited proteasome motility in axons and disrupted synaptic proteostasis, structure, and function. Moreover, phosphorylation of PI31 by p38 MAPK enhanced binding to DYNLL1/2 and promoted the directional movement of proteasomes in axons, suggesting a mechanism to regulate loading of proteasomes onto motors. Inactivation of PI31 in mouse neurons attenuated proteasome movement in axons, indicating this process is conserved. Because mutations affecting PI31 activity are associated with human neurodegenerative diseases, impairment of PI31-mediated axonal transport of proteasomes may contribute to these disorders.},

Due to the dependence on kinesin-based transport, we sought to determine if the kinesin-3 family member, KIF1A, transports DCVs in primary cultured hippocampal neurons, as has been described for invertebrate neurons. Two-color, live-cell imaging showed that the DCV markers, chromogranin A-RFP and BDNF-RFP, move together with KIF1A-GFP in both the anterograde and retrograde directions. To demonstrate a functional role for KIF1A in DCV transport, motor protein expression in neurons was reduced using RNA interference (shRNA). Fluorescently tagged DCV markers showed a significant reduction in organelle flux in cells expressing shRNA against KIF1A. The transport of cargo driven by motors other than KIF1A, including mitochondria and the transferrin receptor, was unaffected in KIF1A shRNA expressing cells. Taken together, these data support a primary role for KIF1A in the anterograde transport of DCVs in mammalian neurons, and also provide evidence that KIF1A remains associated with DCVs during retrograde DCV transport.},

We go on to describe a novel role for ADAM22 in maintaining excitatory synapses through PSD-95/Dlg1/zo-1 (PDZ) domain interactions. Finally, we show that in the absence of LGI1, the mature synapse scaffolding protein PSD-95, but not the immature synapse scaffolding protein SAP102, is unable to modulate synaptic transmission.

  abstract = {Understanding the mechanism underlying axon regeneration is of great practical importance for developing therapeutic treatment for traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries. Dramatic cytoskeleton reorganization occurs at the injury site, and microtubules have been implicated in the regeneration process. Previously we demonstrated that microtubule sliding by conventional kinesin (kinesin-1) is required for initiation of neurite outgrowth in Drosophila embryonic neurons and that sliding is developmentally down-regulated when neurite outgrowth is completed. Here we report that mechanical axotomy of Drosophila neurons in culture triggers axonal regeneration and regrowth. Regenerating neurons contain actively sliding microtubules; this sliding, like sliding during initial neurite outgrowth, is driven by kinesin-1 and is required for axonal regeneration. The injury induces a fast spike of calcium, depolymerization of microtubules near the injury site, and subsequent formation of local new microtubule arrays with mixed polarity. These events are required for reactivation of microtubule sliding at the initial stages of regeneration. Furthermore, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway promotes regeneration by enhancing microtubule sliding in injured mature neurons.}

  abstract = {Efficient degradation of abnormal or aggregated proteins is crucial to protect the cell against proteotoxic stress. Selective targeting and disposal of such proteins usually occurs in a ubiquitin-dependent manner by proteasomes and macroautophagy/autophagy. Whereas proteasomes are efficient in degrading abnormal soluble proteins, protein aggregates are typically targeted for degradation by autophagic vesicles. Both processes require ubiquitin-binding receptors, which are targeted to proteasomes via ubiquitin-like domains or to phagophores (the precursors to autophagosomes) via Atg8/LC3 binding motifs, respectively. The use of substrate modification by ubiquitin in both pathways raised the question of how degradative pathway choice is achieved. In contrast to previous models, proposing different types of ubiquitin linkages for substrate targeting, we find that pathway choice is a late event largely determined by the oligomeric state of the receptors. Monomeric proteasome receptors bind soluble substrates more efficiently due to their higher affinity for ubiquitin. Upon substrate aggregation, autophagy receptors with lower ubiquitin binding affinity gain the upper hand due to higher avidity achieved by receptor bundling. Thus, our work suggests that ubiquitination is a shared signal of an adaptive protein quality control system, which targets substrates for the optimal proteolytic pathway.},

  abstract = {Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to change in strength, requires alterations in synaptic molecule compositions over time, and synapses undergo selective modifications on stimulation. Molecular motors operate in sorting/transport of neuronal proteins; however, the targeting mechanisms that guide and direct cargo delivery remain elusive. We addressed the impact of synaptic transmission on the regulation of intracellular microtubule (MT)-based transport. We show that increased neuronal activity, as induced through GlyR activity blockade, facilitates tubulin polyglutamylation, a posttranslational modification thought to represent a molecular traffic sign for transport. Also, GlyR activity blockade alters the binding of the MT-associated protein MAP2 to MTs. By using the kinesin (KIF5) and the postsynaptic protein gephyrin as models, we show that such changes of MT tracks are accompanied by reduced motor protein mobility and cargo delivery into neurites. Notably, the observed neurite targeting deficits are prevented on functional depletion or gene expression knockdown of neuronal polyglutamylase. Our data suggest a previously undescribed concept of synaptic transmission regulating MT-dependent cargo delivery.}

  abstract = {Autophagy is an essential cellular degradation pathway in neurons; defects in autophagy are sufficient to induce neurodegeneration. In this paper, we investigate autophagosome dynamics in primary dorsal root ganglion neurons. Autophagosome biogenesis occurs distally in a constitutive process at the neurite tip. Autophagosomes initially move bidirectionally and then switch to unidirectional, processive movement toward the cell soma driven by dynein. Autophagosomes copurify with anterograde and retrograde motors, suggesting that the activity of bound kinesin motors is effectively down-regulated to yield robust retrograde motility driven by dynein. Both organelle and soluble cargoes are internalized into autophagosomes, including mitochondria and ubiquitin. As autophagosomes move distally to proximally, they undergo maturation and become increasingly acidified, consistent with the formation of an autolysosomal compartment that may more efficiently degrade cargo. This maturation is accompanied by a switch to bidirectional motility characteristic of lysosomes. Together, autophagosome biogenesis and maturation in primary neurons is a constitutive process that is spatially and temporally regulated along the axon.}

Directed transport as well as local sequestration of synaptic vesicle precursors (SVPs), membranous organelles containing many synaptic proteins, might contribute to this process. Using neuron-wide time-lapse microscopy, we studied SVP dynamics in the DA9 motor neuron in Caenorhabditis elegans. SVP transport was highly dynamic and bi-directional throughout the entire neuron, including the dendrite. While SVP trafficking was anterogradely biased in axonal segments prior to the synaptic domain, directionality of SVP movement was stochastic in the dendrite and distal axon. Furthermore, frequency of movement and speed were variable between different compartments. These data provide evidence that SVP transport is differentially regulated in distinct neuronal domains. It also suggests that polarized SVP transport in concert with local vesicle capturing is necessary for accurate presynapse formation and maintenance. SVP trafficking analysis of two hypomorphs for UNC-104/KIF1A in combination with mathematical modeling identified directionality of movement, entry of SVPs into the axon as well as axonal speeds as the important determinants of steady-state SVP distributions. Furthermore, detailed dissection of speed distributions for wild-type and unc-104/kif1a mutant animals revealed an unexpected role for UNC-104/KIF1A in dendritic SVP trafficking.},

Whereas early studies were focused on how monoubiquitination alters the interactions of proteins containing ubiquitin-binding domains, more recent reports demonstrate that ubiquitin conjugation can also affect the binding mode by changing the surface of the ubiquitinated substrate. Furthermore, monoubiquitination modulates the interactions with other macromolecules, such as DNA or lipids, underscoring the diverse role of monoubiquitination in cellular processes.

The Golgi localization of Dopey1 and Mon2 requires their binding to phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate and phosphatidic acid, respectively, two lipids known for the biogenesis of membrane carriers and the specification of organelle identities. The N-terminus of Dopey1 further interacts with kinesin-1, a plus-end or centrifugal-direction microtubule motor. Dopey1-Mon2 complex functions as a dual-lipid-regulated cargo-adaptor to recruit kinesin-1 to secretory and endocytic organelles or membrane carriers for centrifugally biased bidirectional transport. Dopey1-Mon2 complex therefore provides an important missing link to coordinate the budding of a membrane carrier and subsequent bidirectional transport along the microtubule.},

These `nanomachines' use energy obtained from ATP hydrolysis to generate force2, and move in a step-like manner on microtubules. Dynein3,4,5 has a complex and fundamentally different structure from other motor families. Thus, understanding dynein's force generation can yield new insight into the architecture and function of nanomachines. Here, we use an optical trap6 to quantify motion of polystyrene beads driven along microtubules by single cytoplasmic dynein motors. Under no load, dynein moves predominantly with a mixture of 24-nm and 32-nm steps. When moving against load applied by an optical trap, dynein can decrease step size to 8\,nm and produce force up to 1.1\,pN. This correlation between step size and force production is consistent with a molecular gear mechanism. The ability to take smaller but more powerful strokes under load\textemdash that is, to shift gears\textemdash depends on the availability of ATP. We propose a model whereby the gear is downshifted through load-induced binding of ATP at secondary sites in the dynein head.},

Here, we show that Kif2b is expressed at very low levels in cultured cells and that GFP-Kif2b localizes predominately to centrosomes and midbodies, but also to spindle microtubules and transiently to kinetochores. Kif2b-deficient cells assemble monopolar or disorganized spindles. Chromosomes in Kif2b-deficient cells show typical kinetochore-microtubule attachments, but the velocity of movement is reduced {$\sim$}80\% compared with control cells. Some Kif2b-deficient cells attempt anaphase, but the cleavage furrow regresses and cytokinesis fails. Like Kif2a-deficient cells, bipolar spindle assembly can be restored to Kif2b-deficient cells by simultaneous deficiency of MCAK or Nuf2 or treatment with low doses of nocodazole. However, Kif2b-deficient cells are unique in that they assemble bipolar spindles when the pole focusing activities of NuMA and HSET are perturbed. These data demonstrate that Kif2b function is required for spindle assembly and chromosome movement and that the microtubule depolymerase activities of Kif2a, Kif2b, and MCAK fulfill distinct functions during mitosis in human cells.}

Moreover, analysis of different proteasome and nuclear pore complex assemblies suggests that their turnover rate is architecture dependent. These results illustrate that our approach allows investigating protein turnover and its implications in various cell types.},

To elucidate the functions of KIF1B{$\beta$} in non-neuronal cells, we analyzed the intracellular localization of KIF1B{$\beta$} and characterized its isoform expression profile. In COS-7 cells, KIF1B colocalized with lysosomal markers and expression of a mutant form of KIF1B{$\beta$}, lacking the motor domain, impaired the intracellular distribution of lysosomes. A novel isoform of the kinesin-like protein, KIF1B{$\beta$}3, was identified in rat and simian kidney. It lacks the 5th exon of the KIF1B{$\beta$}-specific tail region. Overexpression of KIF1B{$\beta$}3 induced the translocation of lysosomes to the cell periphery. However, overexpression of KIF1B{$\beta$}3-Q98L, which harbors a pathogenic mutation associated with a familial neuropathy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 A, resulted in the abnormal perinuclear clustering of lysosomes. These results indicate that KIF1B{$\beta$}3 is involved in the translocation of lysosomes from perinuclear regions to the cell periphery.},

  abstract = {Kinesin is an ubiquitous heterotetrameric microtubule-based motor which translocates membrane-bound organelles. Since organelle motility and motor protein function can be regulated by components of signaling pathways, the ability of purified bovine brain kinesin (kinesin) to be phosphorylated and to recognize calmodulin (CaM) was tested. Extensively purified "kinesin" was found to consist of several forms of both heavy (KHC) and light (KLC) chains. Phosphorylation of kinesin by a variety of protein kinases was examined; cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAMP-PK) was the most active enzyme leading to the incorporation of up to 8 mol P/mol kinesin. Phosphorylation occurred predominantly on the KLCs and led to substantial acidic pI shifts. Peptide maps indicated that multiple phosphorylation sites exist on each KLC. Incubation of kinesin in vitro with protein kinase C (PKC) led to the phosphorylation of both KHCs and KLCs. In vivo phosphorylation of KHC and KLCs was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of [32P]-labeled kinesin from cultured rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons; kinesin phosphorylation was stimulated by 8-chlorophenyl-thio-cAMP or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Native bovine brain kinesin was shown to bind 125I-CaM by nucleotide-dependent pelleting with stable microtubules. Specific calcium-dependent binding of 125I-CaM to KLCs but not KHC was found using a ligand blotting assay. cAMP-PK phosphorylated kinesin bound 125I-CaM less well than untreated protein in both ligand blotting and microtubule-pelleting paradigms. Calcium-dependent binding of CaM to kinesin inhibited the ATPase activity of native kinesin but not of cAMP-PK phosphorylated kinesin. These results suggest that the KLCs have a regulatory function and integrate information coming from diverse signaling pathways to modulate the activity and function of kinesin.},

  abstract = {Background In many differentiated cells, microtubules are organized into polarized noncentrosomal arrays, yet few mechanisms that control these arrays have been identified. For example, mechanisms that maintain microtubule polarity in the face of constant remodeling by dynamic instability are not known. Drosophila neurons contain uniform-polarity minus-end-out microtubules in dendrites, which are often highly branched. Because undirected microtubule growth through dendrite branch points jeopardizes uniform microtubule polarity, we have used this system to understand how cells can maintain dynamic arrays of polarized microtubules. Results We find that growing microtubules navigate dendrite branch points by turning the same way, toward the cell body, 98\% of the time and that growing microtubules track along stable microtubules toward their plus ends. Using RNAi and genetic approaches, we show that kinesin-2, and the~+TIPS EB1 and APC, are required for uniform dendrite microtubule polarity. Moreover, the protein-protein interactions and localization of Apc2-GFP and Apc-RFP to branch points suggests that these proteins work together at dendrite branches. The functional importance of this polarity mechanism is demonstrated by the failure of neurons with reduced kinesin-2 to regenerate an axon from a dendrite. Conclusions We conclude that microtubule growth is directed at dendrite branch points and that kinesin-2, APC, and EB1 are likely to play a role in this process. We propose that kinesin-2 is recruited to growing microtubules by~+TIPS and that the motor protein steers growing microtubules at branch points. This represents a newly discovered mechanism for maintaining polarized arrays of microtubules.},

During ageing, neurons experience increased amounts of oxidative stress, perturbed energy homeostasis, accumulation of damaged proteins and lesions in their DNA.Studies of mutations in the genes that cause Huntington's disease or early-onset forms of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have provided evidence that the defective genes exacerbate age-related processes in neurons, including aggregation of pathogenic proteins, oxidative stress and perturbed cellular ion homeostasis.The physical and molecular characteristics of neurons, their functional properties and their location in neural circuits are all likely to influence their fate during ageing. Examples include differences in relative vulnerabilities to excitotoxicity, metabolic stress and neurotoxins.Neurons have an array of mechanisms that might protect them against the adversities of ageing and neurodegenerative disorders, such as antioxidant defences, protein chaperones that prevent protein aggregation and neurotrophic factors that stabilize ion homeostasis and mitochondrial function.Synapses are regions of neurons that are particularly vulnerable to ageing and neurodegenerative disorders. They are prone to excitotoxic damage, as well as damage by pathogenic proteins such as amyloid-{$\beta$} peptide and mutant huntingtin.Data from studies of animal models and human populations suggest that factors that promote healthy ageing, such as regular exercise and reduced energy diets, might also protect the nervous system against neurodegenerative disorders.},

Using peptide sequence analysis and specific mAbs, RanGAP1 was found to be modified by conjugation to a ubiquitin-like protein. Immunoblot analysis and immunolocalization by light and EM demonstrated that the 70-kD unmodified from of RanGAP1 is exclusively cytoplasmic, whereas the 90-kD modified form of RanGAP1 is associated with the cytoplasmic fibers of the NPC. The modified form of RanGAP1 also appeared to associated with the mitotic spindle apparatus during mitosis. These findings have specific implications for Ran function and broad implications for protein regulation by ubiquitin-like modifications.

(b) This rapidly transported material has been shown to consist exclusively of protein, in which the label remains attached to leucine.

These experiments all indicate that the transported protein is synthesized in the retina. However, inhibition of retinal protein synthesis after this protein has been formed does not interfere with the transport mechanism itself.

We searched for all proteins belonging to the E2 enzyme super-family in seven species (Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Arabidopsis thaliana) to identify families and to reconstruct each family's phylogeny. Our phylogenetic analysis of 207 genes led us to define 17 E2 families, with 37 E2 genes, in the human genome. The subdivision of E2 into four classes did not correspond to the phylogenetic tree. The sequence signature HPN (histidine\textendash proline\textendash asparagine), followed by a tryptophan residue at 16 (up to 29) amino acids, was highly conserved. When present, the active cysteine was found 7 to 8 amino acids from the C-terminal end of HPN. The secondary structures were characterized by a canonical alpha/beta fold. Only family 10 deviated from the common organization because the proteins were devoid of enzymatic activity. Family 7 had an insertion between beta strands 1 and 2; families 3, 5 and 14 had an insertion between the active cysteine and the conserved tryptophan. The three-dimensional data of these proteins highlight a strong structural conservation of the core domain. Our analysis shows that the primitive eukaryote ancestor possessed a diversified set of E2 enzymes, thus emphasizing the importance of the Ub pathway. This comprehensive overview of E2 enzymes emphasizes the diversity and evolution of this superfamily and helps clarify the nomenclature and true orthologies. A better understanding of the functions of these enzymes is necessary to decipher several human diseases.},

Liprin-alphas are scaffolding proteins important for synapse structure and electrophysiology. A reported interaction with Kinesin-3 (Kif1a) suggested Liprin-alpha may also be involved in axonal transport. Here, at the light and ultrastructural levels, we discover aberrant accumulations of synaptic vesicle markers (Synaptotagmin and Synaptobrevin-GFP) and clear-core vesicles along Drosophila Liprin-alpha mutant axons. Analysis of presynaptic markers reveals reduced levels at Liprin-alpha synapses. Direct visualization of Synaptobrevin-GFP transport in living animals demonstrates a decrease in anterograde processivity in Liprin-alpha mutants but also an increase in retrograde transport initiation. Pull-down assays reveal that Liprin-alpha interacts with Drosophila Kinesin-1 (Khc) but not dynein. Together, these findings suggest that Liprin-alpha promotes the delivery of synaptic material by a direct increase in kinesin processivity and an indirect suppression of dynein activation. This work is the first to use live observation in Drosophila mutants to demonstrate the role of a scaffolding protein in the regulation of bidirectional transport. It suggests the synaptic strength and morphology defects linked to Liprin-alpha may in part be due to a failure in the delivery of synaptic-vesicle precursors.},

During mitosis, dynein localizes simultaneously to the mitotic spindle, spindle poles, kinetochores and the cell cortex. However, it is unclear what controls the relative targeting of dynein to these locations. As dynein is heavily post-translationally modified, we sought to test a role for these modifications in regulating dynein localization. We find that dynein rapidly and strongly accumulates at mitotic spindle poles following treatment with NSC697923, a small molecule that inhibits the ubiquitin E2 enzyme, Ubc13, or treatment with PYR-41, a ubiquitin E1 inhibitor. Subsets of dynein regulators such as Lis1, ZW10 and Spindly accumulate at the spindle poles, whereas others do not, suggesting that NSC697923 differentially affects specific dynein populations. We additionally find that dynein relocalization induced by NSC697923 or PYR-41 can be suppressed by simultaneous treatment with the non-selective deubiquitinase inhibitor, PR-619. However, we did not observe altered dynein localization following treatment with the selective E1 inhibitor, TAK-243. Although it is possible that off-target effects of NSC697923 and PYR-41 are responsible for the observed changes in dynein localization, the rapid relocalization upon drug treatment highlights the highly dynamic nature of dynein regulation during mitosis.},

How the binding activities of non-motor MAPs are coordinated and how they contribute to the balance and distribution of motor transport is unknown. Here, we examine the relationship between MAP7 and tau owing to their antagonistic roles in vivo. We find that MAP7 and tau compete for binding to microtubules, and determine a mechanism by which MAP7 displaces tau from the lattice. MAP7 promotes kinesin-based transport in vivo and strongly recruits kinesin-1 to the microtubule in vitro, providing evidence for direct enhancement of motor motility by a MAP. Both MAP7 and tau strongly inhibit kinesin-3 and have no effect on cytoplasmic dynein, demonstrating that MAPs differentially control distinct classes of motors. Overall, these results reveal a general principle for how MAP competition dictates access to the microtubule to determine the correct distribution and balance of motor activity.},

Parkin functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase where it can polyubiquitinate a number of its protein substrates, thus targeting them for degradation by the 26~S proteasomal complex. Recent studies have demonstrated that alternative modes of parkin-mediated ubiquitination may serve other non-degradative regulatory roles. In addition, parkin appears to function as a multipurpose neuroprotectant in a number of toxic paradigms. Coupled with these observations, parkin may integrate other gene products associated with parkinsonism, including {$\alpha$}-synuclein, LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2), DJ-1 and PINK1 [PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10)-induced putative kinase 1], into a common biochemical pathway of potential relevance to disease pathogenesis.

The large size and complex subcellular architecture of neurons render them uniquely vulnerable to alterations in axonal transport (AT).

These observations suggest that many AONDs can be categorized as dysferopathies, diseases in which alterations in AT represent a critical component in pathogenesis.

  abstract = {Synaptic pruning is a fundamental process of neuronal circuit refinement in learning and memory. Accumulating evidence suggests that glia participates in sculpting the neuronal circuits through synapse engulfment. However, whether glial involvement in synaptic pruning has a role in memory formation remains elusive. Using newly developed phagocytosis reporter mice and three-dimensional ultrastructural characterization, we found that synaptic engulfment by cerebellar Bergmann glia (BG) frequently occurred upon cerebellum-dependent motor learning in mice. We observed increases in pre- and postsynaptic nibbling by BG along with a reduction in spine volume after learning. Pharmacological blockade of engulfment with Annexin V inhibited both the spine volume reduction and overnight improvement of motor adaptation. These results indicate that BG contribute to the refinement of the mature cerebellar cortical circuit through synaptic engulfment during motor learning.},

  abstract = {Although small molecules such as ATP diffuse freely in the cytosol, many types of cells nonetheless position their mitochondria in regions of intense ATP consumption. We reasoned that in the highly elongated axonal processes of growing neurons in culture, the active growth cone would form a focus of ATP consumption so distant from the cell body as to require the positioning of mitochondria nearby via regulated axonal transport. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the distribution and transport behavior of mitochondria in live, aerobically respiring chick sympathetic neurons. We found that in the distal region of actively growing axons, the distribution of mitochondria was highly skewed toward the growth cone, with a sevenfold higher density in the region immediately adjacent to the growth cone than in the region 100 m away. When axonal outgrowth was blocked by substratum-associated barriers or mild cytochalasin E treatment, the gradient of mitochondrial distribution collapsed as mitochondria exited retrogradely from the distal region, becoming uniformly distributed along the axon within one hour. Analysis of individual mitochondrial behaviors revealed that mito-chondrial movement everywhere was bidirectional but balanced so that net transport was anterograde in growing axons and retrograde in blocked axons. This reversal in net transport derived from two separate modulations of mitochondrial movement. First, moving mitochondria underwent a transition to a persistently stationary state in the region of active growth cones that was reversed when growth cone activity was halted. Second, the fraction of time that mitochondria spent moving anterogradely was sharply reduced in non-growing axons. Together, these could account for the formation of gradients of mitochondria in growing axons and their dissipation when outgrowth was blocked. This regulated transport behavior was not dependent upon the ability of mitochondria to produce ATP. Our data indicate that mitochondria possess distinct motor activities for both directions of movement and that mitochondrial transport in axons is regulated by both recruitment between stationary and moving states, and direct regulation of the anterograde motor.}

  abstract = {A large body of evidence indicates that microtubules (MTs) conduct organelle transport in axons, but recent studies on extruded squid axoplasm have suggested that actin microfilaments (MFs) may also play a role in this process. To investigate the separate contributions to transport of each class of cytoskeletal element in intact vertebrate axons, we have monitored mitochondrial movements in chick sympathetic neurons experimentally manipulated to eliminate MTs, MFs, or both. First, we grew neurons in the continuous presence of: (a) cytochalasin E to create neurites which had never contained MFs; or (b) nocodazole or vinblastine to produce neurites which had never contained MTs. Mitochondria moved bidirectionally at normal velocities along the length of neurites which contained MTs and lacked MFs, but did not even enter neurites grown without MTs but containing MFs. In a second approach, we treated established neuronal cultures with cytoskeletal drugs to disrupt either MTs or MFs in axons already containing mitochondria. In cytochalasin-treated cells, which retained MTs but lacked MFs, average mitochondrial velocity increased in both directions, but net directional transport decreased. In vinblastine-treated cells, which lacked MTs but retained essentially normal levels of MFs, mitochondria continued to move bidirectionally but the average mitochondrial velocity and excursion length were reduced for both directions of movement, and the mitochondria spent threefold as much time moving in the retrograde as in the anterograde direction, resulting in net retrograde transport. Treatment of established cultures with both drugs produced neurites lacking MTs and MFs but still rich in neurofilaments; these showed a striking absence of any mitochondrial motility. These data indicate that axonal organelle transport can occur along both MTs and MFs in vivo, but with different velocities and net transport properties.}

One motor species always moves in one direction, e.g., conventional kinesin moves to the microtubule plus end, whereas cytoplasmic dynein moves to the microtubule minus end. However, many cellular cargoes are observed to move bidirectionally, involving both plus- and minus-end-directed motors. The presumably simplest mechanism for such bidirectional transport is provided by a tug-of-war between the two motor species. This mechanism is studied theoretically using the load-dependent transport properties of individual motors as measured in single-molecule experiments. In contrast to previous expectations, such a tug-of-war is found to be highly cooperative and to exhibit seven different motility regimes depending on the precise values of the single motor parameters. The sensitivity of the transport process to small parameter changes can be used by the cell to regulate its cargo traffic.}

We have recently shown theoretically that this bidirectional transport can be understood as a stochastic tug-of-war between the two motor teams. Here, we further develop our theory to investigate the experimentally accessible dynamic behavior of cargos transported by strong motors such as kinesin-1 or cytoplasmic dynein. By studying the run and binding times of such a cargo, we show that the properties of biological motors, such as the large ratio of stall/detachment force and the small ratio of superstall backward/forward velocity, are favorable for bidirectional cargo transport, leading to fast motion and enhanced diffusion. In addition, cargo processivity is shown to be strongly enhanced by transport via several molecular motors even if these motors are engaged in a tug-of-war. Finally, we study the motility of a bidirectional cargo under force. Frictional forces arising, e.g., from the viscous cytoplasm, lead to peaks in the velocity distribution, while external forces as exerted, e.g., by an optical trap, lead to hysteresis effects. Our results, in particular our explicit expressions for the cargo binding time and the distance of the peaks in the velocity relation under friction, are directly accessible to in~vitro as well as in~vivo experiments.},

Here we analyzed axonal RNA transport in goldfish Mauthner neurons in vivo. BC1 RNA, a noncoding RNA polymerase III transcript that is targeted to dendrites in neurons of the rodent nervous system, was used as a probe for axonal RNA transport. Somata of Mauthner neurons were microinjected with various RNAs. Full-length BC1 RNA, but not control RNAs of similar length, was targeted to both axons and dendrites of Mauthner neurons. BC1 RNA was transported in the form of a rapidly advancing wave front that progressed along axons, in a microtubule-dependent manner, at a rate of 2 {$\mu$}m/sec. Whereas a BC1 5{${'}$} segment of 65 nucleotides was transported to axons and dendrites in a way indistinguishable from full-length BC1 RNA, a BC1 3{${'}$} segment of 60 nucleotides did not enter Mauthner cell processes to any significant extent. In the wake of the wave advancing through the axon, BC1 RNA was found localized to discrete, spatially delimited domains at the axonal surface. Such demarcated cortical concentrations of BC1 RNA could not be observed after disruption of F-actin organization in the axon. It is concluded that the specific delivery of BC1 RNA to spatially defined axonal target sites is a two-step process that requires the sequential participation of microtubules for long-range axial transport and of actin filaments for local radial transfer and focal accumulation in cortical domains.},

  abstract = {In 1860, the~German anatomist Otto Friedrich Karl Deiters (1834-1863) described the basic structure of the nerve cell and identified two different protoplasmatic protrusions of the cell body that he termed as~"axis cylinder," and "protoplasmatic processes," respectively axons and dendrites. Axons are the elongated portion of the neuron located in the center of the cell between the soma and axon terminals. In size, the axon may represent over 95\% of the total volume of the neuron. Functionally, it carries electrical impulses and projects to synapses with dendrites or cell bodies of other~neurons or with non-neuronal targets such as muscle fibers. Concerning length, the length of axons varies according to the function of the neuron. Considering the functional distinction between projection neurons and interneurons, cortical projection neurons (CPNs), also termed as pyramidal neurons and spinal cord projection neurons (dorsal horn neurons),~usually have long axons (from several mm and up to 1 m). In contrast, interneurons, that work within local circuits, have a short axonal terminal (up to several mm). The longest axons of the human body are those that make up the sciatic nerve where the length can exceed one meter. Furthermore, compared to projecting neurons, interneurons usually have smaller soma, fewer organelles, and a reduced amount of cytoplasm (axoplasm). Histological observation of axon shows a cylindrical structure, but recent 3D electron microscopy studies demonstrated that probably axon has not the shape of a perfect cylinder. The diameter is variable as it ranges between 1 and 25 micrometers. In squid, it reaches a diameter of 1 mm. The variation of the diameter has important functional implications since the speed of propagation of the impulse (i.e., action potential), besides being dependent on the presence of the myelin sheath, is directly proportional to the diameter of the axon. Moreover, they have demonstrated significant changes in the diameter along the single axon. The axon is one of two types of protoplasmic protrusions of the neuronal soma. The other protrusion is the dendrites. Axons are distinguished from dendrites by several characteristics including: Shape. Dendrites are usually thin while axons typically maintain a constant radius. Length. Dendrites are limited to a small region around the cell body while axons can be much longer. Structure.~Substantial structural differences exist between dendrites and axons. For example, only dendrites contain rough endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes, and the structure of the cytoskeleton is different. Differences also affect the membrane as it contains mostly voltage-gated ion~channels in axons, whereas ligand-gated ion~channels are present, especially in dendrites. Functions. Dendrites usually receive signals, while axons typically transmit them. However, all these rules have exceptions. Furthermore, axons generate and transmit~all-or-none action potential,~whereas dendrites produce depolarizing (below the threshold of the action potential) or hyperpolarizing (lowering the resting membrane potential) graded potentials. Of note, although each neuron has only one axon, bifurcations that are branches of the main axon can be present. A collateral branch is an axonal protrusion over10 micrometers in length. These collaterals provide modulation and regulation of the cell firing pattern and represent a~feedback system for the neuronal activity. The terminal part of the axon and collaterals tapers progressively. These parts are called telodendron and continue with the synapse (synaptic knob or button) which represents the specialized structure that comes into contact~with another neuron (soma, axon or dendrite), or muscle fiber. Axon extension and growth of new telodendrons (and synapses) are guided by several factors, including the nerve growth factor (NGF). The branching processes, in turn, play a role of fundamental importance in neuroplasticity, for instance, in cognitive processes such as memory and learning. Anatomically and based on the appearance of the protoplasmatic protrusions, neurons are classified into three groups: Multipolar neurons. They are the~most common neurons; Shape: a single axon and many dendrites extending from the cell body. Localization: central nervous system (CNS). Unipolar (or pseudounipolar) neurons.~Shape:~a single short process that extends from the cell body and then splits into two branches in opposite directions; one branch travels to the peripheral nervous system (PNS) for the sensory reception, and the other to the CNS (central process). These neurons have no dendrites as the branched axon serving both functions.~Localization: dorsal root ganglion and sensory ganglia of cranes nerves, and some mesencephalic nucleus.  Bipolar neurons.~Shape:~one axon and one dendrite that extend from the cell body in opposite directions. Localization:~retinal cells and olfactory~system. Two notable features distinguish the axon from the soma (also referred to as perikaryon). First, no rough endoplasmic reticulum extends into the axon; secondly, the composition of the axonic membrane (axolemma) is fundamentally different from that of the somatic membrane. These structural differences translate into functional distinctions. In fact, since the absence of ribosomes does not allow protein synthesis, all axon proteins originate in the soma. Furthermore, the particular structure of the membrane due to the presence of specific protein channels allows information to travel along the course of the axon. Again, depending on the location within the body, these structures can be covered in sheaths of an insulating material known as myelin.~Based on the presence or absence of the myelin sheath, axons are distinguishable into myelinated and non-myelinated axons.~ Myelin sheath Myelin forms by the concentric wraps of the plasma membrane of neuroglia cells around the axon. These cells are the Schwann cells (or neurolemmocytes) in the PNS and oligodendrocytes in the CNS. As a general rule, oligodendrocytes myelinate multiple adjacent axons, while Schwann cells myelinate only one axon. In structural terms, the myelin sheath wraps the axons discontinuously as it is interrupted at regular intervals called Ranvier nodes (also termed as myelin sheath gaps), which represent the space between two consecutive Schwann cells and at which the axon is devoid of the sheath. In this way, employing the jump mechanism from one Ranvier node to the next, the propagation of the electrical signal is much faster than in the myelin sheathed axons. The cell membrane of Schwann cells is arranged around the axon, forming a double membrane structure (mesaxon), which elongates and wraps itself in a spiral, in concentric layers, around the axon itself. During this winding process, the cytoplasm of the Schwann cell is pushed towards the outside, while the surfaces of the contact membranes end up condensing, forming the lamellae of the myelin sheath. When the myelin sheath wraps around the axon, the mesaxon disappears by fusion of the cytoplasmic membranes in contact, except in correspondence with the innermost gyrus (internal mesaxon) and the outermost gyrus (external mesaxon or neurilemma) where there is a turn outermost rich in the cytoplasm. When the myelin sheath forms by oligodendrocytes (in PNS), the outermost gyrus reduces to a tongue and, in turn, although there is the internal mesaxon, the external one is not recognizable. Functionally, myelin represents an electrical insulator, allowing an increased speed of conduction along with an~axon. It facilitates electrical transmission via saltatory conduction.~Structurally, myelin is composed of approximately 80\% of lipids (mostly~cholesterol and variable amounts of cerebrosides and phospholipids) and 20\% of proteins. However, depending on its location, myelin has a different composition as CNS myelin has more~glycolipid and less phospholipid than PNS myelin.},

  abstract = {Neurons are polarized cells, with dendrites and axons that require different complements of membrane proteins to fulfill their specialized functions. Membrane proteins are synthesized in the somatodendritic domain and delivered to their target membranes via long-range vesicle transport. Most anterograde vesicle transport is mediated by kinesin motors, but it is unclear how kinesins are targeted to axons or dendrites. Two main models have been proposed to explain kinesin selectivity. In the smart motor model, kinesin selectivity is conferred by a preference of the kinesin motor domain for specific subsets of microtubules. In the cargo steering model, kinesin selectivity is modulated by the vesicular cargo to which the motor is bound. We evaluate the evidence for both models and conclude that while the smart motor model may explain axonal selectivity, cargo steering is required for dendritic selectivity. Future work will determine the relative contributions of these models to polarized transport in living neurons.},

In C. elegans neurons, we found that some SVps are transported along with lysosomal proteins by the motor UNC-104/KIF1A. LRK-1/LRRK2 and the clathrin adaptor protein complex AP-3 are critical for the separation of lysosomal proteins from SVp transport carriers. In lrk-1 mutants, both SVp carriers and SVp carriers containing lysosomal proteins are independent of UNC-104, suggesting that LRK-1 plays a key role in ensuring UNC-104-dependent transport of SVps. Additionally, LRK-1 likely acts upstream of the AP-3 complex and regulates the membrane localization of AP-3. The action of AP-3 is necessary for the active zone protein SYD-2/Liprin-{$\alpha$} to facilitate the transport of SVp carriers. In the absence of the AP-3 complex, SYD-2/Liprin-{$\alpha$} acts with UNC-104 to instead facilitate the transport of SVp carriers containing lysosomal proteins. We further show that the mistrafficking of SVps into the dendrite in lrk-1 and apb-3 mutants depends on SYD-2, likely by regulating the recruitment of the AP-1/UNC-101. We propose that SYD-2 acts in concert with both the AP-1 and AP-3 complexes to ensure polarized trafficking of SVps.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.}

However, the pathogenic mechanism of the diseases linked to TDP-43 is largely unknown. We hypothesized that the failure of mRNA transport to neuronal axons by TDP-43 may contribute to neurodegeneration in ALS and FTLD, and sought to examine the function of TDP-43 by identifying its target mRNA for axonal transport. We found that mRNAs related to translational function including ribosomal proteins (RPs) were decreased by shRNA-based TDP-43 knock-down in neurites of cortical neurons. TDP-43 binds to and transports the RP mRNAs through their 5{${'}$} untranslated region, which contains a common 5{${'}$} terminal oligopyrimidine tract motif and a downstream GC-rich region. We showed by employing in vitro and in vivo models that the RP mRNAs were translated and incorporated into native ribosomes locally in axons to maintain functionality of axonal ribosomes, which is required for local protein synthesis in response to stimulation and stress to axons. We also found that RP mRNAs were reduced in the pyramidal tract of sporadic ALS cases harboring TDP-43 pathology. Our results elucidated a novel function of TDP-43 to control transport of RP mRNAs and local translation by ribosomes to maintain morphological integrity of neuronal axons, and proved the influence of this function of TDP-43 on neurodegeneration in ALS and FTLD associated with TDP-43 proteinopathy.},

To assess these questions we introduced cDNA of wild-type and site-directed mutant kinesin heavy chains into fibroblasts, and analyzed the behavior of the recombinant proteins and the mechanisms involved in organelle transports. Overexpression of wild-type kinesin significantly promoted elongation of cellular processes. Wild-type kinesin accumulated at the tips of the long processes, whereas the kinesin mutants, which contained either a T93N- or T93I mutation in the ATP-binding motif, tightly bound to microtubules in the center of the cells. These mutant kinesins could bind to microtubules in vitro, but could not dissociate from them even in the presence of ATP, and did not support microtubule motility in vitro, thereby indicating rigor-type mutations. Retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as lysosome dispersion, was shown to be a microtubule-dependent, plus-end-directed movement. The latter was selectively blocked in the rigor-mutant cells, although the microtubule minus-end-directed motion of lysosomes was not affected. We found the point mutations that make kinesin motor in strong binding state with microtubules in vitro and showed that this mutant causes a dominant effect that selectively blocks anterograde lysosome membrane transports in vivo.}

We have successfully visualized the transporting vesicles of plasma membrane proteins, synaptic vesicle proteins, and the trans-Golgi network residual proteins in living axons at high resolution using laser scan microscopy of green fluorescent protein-tagged proteins after photobleaching. We found that all of these proteins are transported by tubulovesicular organelles of various sizes and shapes that circulate within axons from branch to branch and switch the direction of movement. These organelles are distinct from the endosomal compartments and constitute a new entity of membrane organelles that mediate the transport of newly synthesized proteins from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane.}

However, the genetic causes and the cellular mechanisms that trigger this process are still largely unknown. Based on forward genetic screening in C. elegans, we have identified the alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase gene mec-17 as causing spontaneous, adult-onset, and progressive axonal degeneration. Loss of MEC-17 leads to microtubule instability, a reduction in mitochondrial number, and disrupted axonal transport, with altered distribution of both mitochondria and synaptic components. Furthermore, mec-17-mediated axonal degeneration occurs independently from its acetyltransferase domain; is enhanced by mutation of coel-1, a tubulin-associated molecule; and correlates with the animal's body length. This study therefore identifies a critical role for the conserved microtubule-associated protein MEC-17 in preserving axon integrity and preventing axonal degeneration.},

Kinesin molecules move primarily in the forward direction and only occasionally in the backward direction. The hydrolysis of a single ATP molecule is coupled to either the forward or the backward movement. This bidirectional movement is well described by a model of Brownian motion assuming an asymmetric potential of activation energy. Thus, the stepwise movement along the microtubule is most probably due to Brownian motion that is biased towards the forward direction by chemical energy stored in ATP molecules.},

In the synaptosome transcriptome, or `synaptome', profiling of both mouse and human brain samples, we detect subclusters among synaptosomes that are associated with neuronal subtypes and characterize the landscape of transcript splicing that occurs within synapses. We extend synaptome profiling to synaptopathy in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model and discover AD-associated synaptic gene expression changes that cannot be detected by single-nucleus transcriptome profiling. Overall, our results show that this platform provides a high-throughput, single-synaptosome transcriptome profiling tool that will facilitate future discoveries in neuroscience.},

The conserved ARF-like small GTPase ARL-8 is localized to SVPs and directly activates UNC-104/KIF1A, the axonal-transport kinesin for SVPs in C.~elegans. It is not clear how ARL-8 is activated in this process. Here we show that part of the BLOC-1-related complex (BORC), previously shown to regulate lysosomal transport, is required to recruit and activate ARL-8 on SVPs. We found mutations in six BORC subunits\textemdash blos-1/BLOS1, blos-2/BLOS2, snpn-1/Snapin, sam-4/Myrlysin, blos-7/Lyspersin, and blos-9/MEF2BNB\textemdash cause defects in axonal transport of SVPs, leading to ectopic accumulation of synaptic vesicles in the proximal axon. This phenotype is suppressed by constitutively active arl-8 or unc-104 mutants. Furthermore, SAM-4/Myrlysin,~a subunit of BORC, promotes the GDP-to-GTP exchange of ARL-8 in~vitro and recruits ARL-8 onto SVPs in~vivo. Thus, BORC regulates the axonal transport of synaptic materials and synapse formation by controlling the nucleotide state of ARL-8. Interestingly, the other two subunits of BORC essential for lysosomal transport, kxd-1/KXD1 and blos-8/Diaskedin, are not required for the SVP transport, suggesting distinct subunit requirements for lysosomal and SVP trafficking.},

From these screens, we identified at least 50 conserved genes with growth-promoting or growth-inhibiting functions. Through our analysis of mutants, we shed new light on certain aspects of regeneration, including the role of {$\beta$}-spectrin and membrane dynamics, the antagonistic activity of MAP kinase signaling pathways, and the role of stress in promoting axon regeneration.

In neurons, rab3 has been proposed to play a crucial role in regulating synaptic vesicle release. To elucidate the role of rab3 in synaptic transmission, we isolated and characterizedCaenorhabditis elegans rab-3 mutants. Similar to the mouse rab3A mutants, these mutants survived and exhibited only mild behavioral abnormalities. In contrast to the mouse mutants, synaptic transmission was perturbed in these animals. Extracellular electrophysiological recordings revealed that synaptic transmission in the pharyngeal nervous system was impaired. Furthermore,rab-3 animals were resistant to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor aldicarb, suggesting that cholinergic transmission was generally depressed. Last, synaptic vesicle populations were redistributed in rab-3 mutants. In motor neurons, vesicle populations at synapses were depleted to 40\% of normal levels, whereas in intersynaptic regions of the axon, vesicle populations were elevated. On the basis of the morphological defects at neuromuscular junctions, we postulate that RAB-3 may regulate recruitment of vesicles to the active zone or sequestration of vesicles near release sites.},

Landing sites for this approach are available on four chromosomes in several configurations which yield lines marked in distinct cell types. An array of vectors permit creating transgenes using a variety of selection methods (HygR, NeoR, PuroR, unc-119(+)) that yield lines expressing different colored FP tagged lines (BFP, GFP, mNG, and Scarlet). Although these transgenes retain a plasmid backbone and a selection marker, the inclusion of these sequences typically does not alter the expression of several cell specific promoters tested. However, in certain orientations promoters exhibits crosstalk with adjacent transcription units. In cases where crosstalk is problematic, the loxP-flanked fluorescent marker, plasmid backbone and hygR gene can be excised by crossing through germline Cre expressing lines also created using this technique. Finally, genetic and molecular reagents designed to facilitate customization of both targeting vectors and landing sites are also described. Together, the rRMCE toolbox provides a platform for developing further innovative uses of RMCE to create complex genetically engineered tools.},

Fast transport was differentiated from the slow mechanism of axoplasmic flow by injecting 3H-leucine into one L7 ganglion and 32P-orthophosphate into the opposite one of the same animals, the labelled components of the latter moving down the nerve at the much slower rate characteristic of slow axoplasmic transport. The mechanism underlying fast transport is locally present all along the nerve fibers; the soma is not responsible for propulsion.

Recently, a multiprotein complex containing pVHL, elongin C and Cul2 (VEC) was shown to structurally and functionally resemble SCF complexes. Cdc53 and the Cullins can become covalently linked to the ubiquitin-like molecule Rub1/NEDD8. Inhibition of neddylation inhibits SCF function in vitro and in yeast and plants. Here we show that ongoing neddylation is likewise required for VEC function in vitro and for the degradation of SCF and VEC targets in mammalian cells. Thus, neddylation regulates the activity of two specific subclasses of mammalian ubiquitin ligases.},

  abstract = {NEDD8 is a small ubiquitin-like protein that modifies target proteins in a reaction similar to ubiquitination. In this reaction, three enzymes are required and sufficient: NEDD8 activating E1-like enzyme (APP-BP1/Uba3), NEDD8-specific E2 enzyme (Ubc12) and RING-finger protein ROC1 (NEDD8 E3 ligase). Unlike ubiquitin, which is well known to form poly-ubiquitin chain, little is known about the formation of poly-NEDD8 chain. Here we show the mechanism of poly-NEDD8 chain formation on Cullin-1 using a complete in vitro reconstituted NEDD8 conjugation system. Intriguingly, poly-NEDD8 chain was build up on catalytic Cysteine residue of Ubc12. Furthermore, Ubc12 formed poly-NEDD8 chain without the activity of ROC1. Rather ROC1 mutant, defective for ubiquitin ligase activity, dramatically enhanced the poly-NEDD8 chain formation. In turn, ROC1 was essential for the transfer of poly-NEDD8 chain from Ubc12 to Cul-1. These results suggest the important regulatory role of ROC1 for poly-NEDD8 chain formation.},

To elucidate the function of this mechanism, we have cloned KIF1A, a novel neuron-specific kinesin superfamily motor that was discovered to be a monomeric, globular molecule and that had the fastest reported anterograde motor activity (1.2 microns/s). To identify its cargo, membranous organelles were isolated from the axon. KIF1A was associated with organelles that contained synaptic vesicle proteins such as synaptotagmin, synaptophysin, and Rab3A. However, this organelle did not contain SV2, another synaptic vesicle protein, nor did it contain presynaptic membrane proteins, such as syntaxin 1A or SNAP-25, or other known anterograde motor proteins, such as kinesin and KIF3. Thus, we suggest that the membrane proteins are sorted into different classes of transport organelles in the cell body and are transported by their specific motor proteins through the axon.},

This dimeric structure poses a barrier to solving its mechanism. To overcome this problem, we used an unconventional kinesin KIF1A (refs 5, 6) as a model molecule. KIF1A moves processively as an independent monomer, and can also work synergistically as a functional dimer. Here we show, by measuring its movement with an optical trapping system, that a single ATP hydrolysis triggers a single stepping movement of a single KIF1A monomer. The step size is distributed stochastically around multiples of 8 nm with a gaussian-like envelope and a standard deviation of 15 nm. On average, the step is directional to the microtubule's plus-end against a load force of up to 0.15 pN. As the source for this directional movement, we show that KIF1A moves to the microtubule's plus-end by approximately 3 nm on average on binding to the microtubule, presumably by preferential binding to tubulin on the plus-end side. We propose a simple physical formulation to explain the movement of KIF1A.},

We systemically examined this question at synapses onto newly characterized dendritic spines of C. elegans GABAergic motor neurons. We show that the presynaptic adhesion protein neurexin/NRX-1 is required for stabilization of postsynaptic structure. We find that early postsynaptic developmental events proceed without a strict requirement for synaptic activity and are not disrupted by deletion of neurexin/nrx-1. However, in the absence of presynaptic NRX-1, dendritic spines and receptor clusters become destabilized and collapse prior to adulthood. We demonstrate that NRX-1 delivery to presynaptic terminals is dependent on kinesin-3/UNC-104 and show that ongoing UNC-104 function is required for postsynaptic maintenance in mature animals. By defining the dynamics and temporal order of synapse formation and maintenance events in vivo, we describe a mechanism for stabilizing mature circuit connectivity through neurexin-based adhesion.},

However, surveillance mechanisms that specifically respond to stalled ribosomes with an occluded A site have not been identified. We discovered that the elongation factor-1{$\alpha$} (eEF1A) inhibitor, ternatin-4, triggers the ubiquitination and degradation of eEF1A on stalled ribosomes. Using a chemical genetic approach, we unveiled a signaling network comprising two E3 ligases, RNF14 and RNF25, which are required for eEF1A degradation. Quantitative proteomics revealed the RNF14 and RNF25-dependent ubiquitination of eEF1A and a discrete set of ribosomal proteins. The ribosome collision sensor GCN1 plays an essential role by engaging RNF14, which directly ubiquitinates eEF1A. The site-specific, RNF25-dependent ubiquitination of the ribosomal protein RPS27A/eS31 provides a second essential signaling input. Our findings illuminate a ubiquitin signaling network that monitors the ribosomal A site and promotes the degradation of stalled translation factors, including eEF1A and the termination factor eRF1.},

Basally, ubiquitylated translocon import substrates accumulate, suggesting a quality control function for USP30. p97 was dispensable for Parkin ligase activity in iNeurons.

How neurons~generate acentrosomal microtubules remains unclear. Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) neurons lack centrosomes and therefore provide a model system to study acentrosomal microtubule nucleation. Here, we investigate the origin of microtubules within the elaborate dendritic arbor of class IV da neurons. Using a combination of in~vivo and in~vitro techniques, we find that Golgi outposts can directly nucleate microtubules throughout the arbor. This acentrosomal nucleation requires gamma-tubulin and CP309, the Drosophila homolog of AKAP450, and contributes to the complex microtubule organization within the arbor and dendrite branch growth and stability. Together, these results identify a direct mechanism for acentrosomal microtubule nucleation within neurons and reveal a function for Golgi outposts in this process.},

Its single-headed form is known to be very inefficient due to the presence of a diffusive state in the mechanochemical cycle. However, recent theoretical studies have suggested that these motors could largely enhance force generation by working in teams. Here we test this prediction by challenging single-headed KIF1A to extract membrane tubes from giant vesicles along microtubule filaments in a minimal in vitro system. Remarkably, not only KIF1A motors are able to extract tubes but they feature a novel phenomenon: tubes are wound around microtubules forming tubular helices. This finding reveals an unforeseen combination of cooperative force generation and self-organized manoeuvreing capability, suggesting that the diffusive state may be a key ingredient for collective motor performance under demanding traffic conditions. Hence, we conclude that KIF1A is a genuinely cooperative motor, possibly explaining its specificity to axonal trafficking.},

We have now developed a method for the efficient identification of ubiquitylation sites in target proteins with the use of an engineered form of ubiquitin (K0-Ub), in which all seven lysine residues are replaced with arginine. K0-Ub is covalently attached to lysine residues of target proteins via an isopeptide bond, but further formation of a polyubiquitin chain does not occur on K0-Ub. We identified a total of 1392 ubiquitylation sites of 794 proteins from HEK293T cells. Profiling of ubiquitylation sites indicated that the sequences surrounding lysine residues targeted for ubiquitin conjugation do not share a common motif or structural feature. Furthermore, we identified a critical ubiquitylation site of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1). Mutation of this site thus inhibited ubiquitylation of and stabilized p27(Kip1), suggesting that this lysine residue is the target site of p27(Kip1) for ubiquitin conjugation in vivo. In conclusion, our method based on K0-Ub is a powerful tool for proteome-wide identification of ubiquitylation sites of target proteins.},

In neurodegenerative diseases, aggregation and accumulation of proteins in axons link transport defects with degradation impairments; however, the transport properties of proteasomes remain unknown. Here, using in vivo experiments, we reveal the fast anterograde transport of assembled and functional 26S proteasome complexes. A high-resolution tracking system to follow fluorescent proteasomes revealed three types of motion: actively driven proteasome axonal transport, diffusive behavior in a viscoelastic axonema and proteasome-confined motion. We show that active proteasome transport depends on motor function because knockdown of the KIF5B motor subunit resulted in impairment of the anterograde proteasome flux and the density of segmental velocities. Finally, we reveal that neuronal proteasomes interact with intracellular membranes and identify the coordinated transport of fluorescent proteasomes with synaptic precursor vesicles, Golgi-derived vesicles, lysosomes and mitochondria. Taken together, our results reveal fast axonal transport as a new mechanism of proteasome delivery that depends on membrane cargo `hitch-hiking' and the function of molecular motors. We further hypothesize that defects in proteasome transport could promote abnormal protein clearance in neurodegenerative diseases.}

To address this problem in neurons, we developed a direct quantitative method for accurately determining the pH of endocytic organelles in live cells. In this report, we demonstrate that the ratiometric fluorescent pH indicator 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (HPTS) is the most advantageous available probe for such pH measurements. To measure intraorganelle pH, cells were labeled by endocytic uptake of HPTS, the ratio of fluorescence emission intensities at excitation wavelengths of 450 nm and 405 nm (F450/405) was calculated for each organelle, and ratios were converted to pH values by using standard curves for F450/405 vs. pH. Proper calibration is critical for accurate measurement of pH values: standard curves generated in vitro yielded artifactually low organelle pH values. Calibration was unaffected by the use of culture medium buffered with various buffers or different cell types. By using this technique, we show that both acidic and neutral endocytically derived organelles exist in the axons of sympathetic neurons in different steady-state proportions than in the cell body. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these axonal organelles have a bimodal pH distribution, indicating a rapid acidification step in their maturation that reduces the average pH of a fraction of the organelles by 2 pH units while leaving few organelles of intermediate pH at steady state. Finally, we demonstrate a spatial gradient or organelle pH along axons, with the relative frequency of acidic organelles increasing with proximity to the cell body.},

Here we have isolated mutations in immaculate connections (imac; CG8566), a previously uncharacterized Drosophila gene encoding a member of the Kinesin-3 family. Whereas earlier studies in Drosophila implicated Kinesin-1 in transporting synaptic vesicle precursors, we find that Imac is essential for this transport. An unexpected feature of imac mutants is the failure of synaptic boutons to form. Motor neurons lacking imac properly target to muscles but remain within target fields as thin processes, a structure that is distinct from either growth cones or mature terminals. Few active zones form at these endings. We show that the arrest of synaptogenesis is not a secondary consequence of the absence of transmission. Our data thus indicate that Imac transports components required for synaptic maturation and provide insight into presynaptic maturation as a process that can be differentiated from axon outgrowth and targeting.},

  abstract = {Increased phosphorylation of the KIF5 anterograde motor is associated with impaired axonal transport and neurodegeneration, but paradoxically also with normal transport, though the details are not fully defined. JNK phosphorylates KIF5C on S176 in the motor domain; a site that we show is phosphorylated in brain. Microtubule pelleting assays demonstrate that phosphomimetic KIF5C(1-560)(S176D) associates weakly with microtubules compared to KIF5C(1-560)(WT). Consistent with this, 50\% of KIF5C(1-560)(S176D) shows diffuse movement in neurons. However, the remaining 50\% remains microtubule bound and displays decreased pausing and increased bidirectional movement. The same directionality switching is observed with KIF5C(1-560)(WT) in the presence of an active JNK chimera, MKK7-JNK. Yet, in cargo trafficking assays where peroxisome cargo is bound, KIF5C(1-560)(S176D)-GFP-FRB transports normally to microtubule plus ends. We also find that JNK increases the ATP hydrolysis of KIF5C in vitro. These data suggest that phosphorylation of KIF5C-S176 primes the motor to either disengage entirely from microtubule tracks as previously observed in response to stress, or to display improved efficiency. The final outcome may depend on cargo load and motor ensembles.},

  abstract = {During early divisions of the C. elegans embryo, many maternally supplied determinants accumulate asymmetrically, and this asymmetry is crucial for proper cell fate specification. SKN-1, a transcription factor whose message is maternally supplied to the embryo, specifies the mesendodermal cell fate. In the 2-cell embryo, SKN-1 is expressed at a higher level in the posterior cell. This asymmetry becomes more pronounced at the 4-cell stage,when SKN-1 is high in the posterior cell's daughters and low in the daughters of the anterior blastomere. To date, the direct mechanisms that control SKN-1 distribution remain unknown. In this report, we identify eel-1, which encodes a putative Hect E3 ubiquitin ligase that shares several domains of similarity to the mammalian E3 ligase Mule. EEL-1 binds SKN-1 and appears to target SKN-1 for degradation. EEL-1 has two functions in regulating SKN-1 during early embryogenesis. First, eel-1 promotes the spatial asymmetry of SKN-1 accumulation at the 2- and 4-cell stages. Second, eel-1 acts in all cells to downregulate SKN-1 from the 12- to the 28-cell stage. Although loss of eel-1 alone causes a reduction in SKN-1 asymmetry at the 2-cell stage, the function of eel-1 in both the spatial and temporal regulation of SKN-1 is redundant with the activities of other genes. These data strongly suggest that multiple, functionally redundant pathways cooperate to ensure precise control of SKN-1 asymmetry and persistence in the early embryo.}

Close apposition of the limiting membranes of presynaptic and postsynaptic cells without any protoplasmic continuity across the synapse. The two apposed membranes are separated by a cleft about 200 A wide, and display localized regions of thickening and increased density. 2. The presynaptic expansion of the axon, the end-foot or bouton terminal, contains a collection of mitochondria and clusters of small vesicles about 200 to 650 A in diameter. Although the significance of these structures in the physiology of the synapse is still unknown, two suggestions are made: that the mitochondria, by means of the relation between their enzymatic activity and ion transport, participate in the electrical phenomena about the synapse; and that the small synaptic vesicles provide the morphological representation of the prejunctional, subcellular units of neurohumoral discharge at the synapse demanded by physiological evidence.},

Using competitive in vitro MT gliding assays, we show that purified kinesin-II and OSM-3 cooperate to generate movement similar to that seen along the cilium in the absence of any additional regulatory factors. Quantitative modeling suggests that this could reflect an alternating action mechanism, in which the motors take turns to move along MTs, or a mechanical competition, in which the motors function in a concerted fashion to move along MTs with the slow motor exerting drag on the fast motor and vice versa. In vivo transport assays performed in Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) protein and IFT motor mutants favor a mechanical competition model for motor coordination in which the IFT motors exert a BBS protein\textendash dependent tension on IFT particles, which controls the IFT pathway that builds the cilium foundation.}

  abstract = {Axonal transport is key to neuronal function. Efficient transport requires specific motor-cargo association in the soma, yet the mechanisms regulating this early step remain poorly understood. We found that EBP-1, the C. elegans ortholog of the canonical microtubule end binding protein EB1, promotes the specific association between kinesin-3/KIF1A/UNC-104 and Dense Core Vesicles (DCVs) prior to their axonal delivery. Using single-neuron, in vivo labelling of endogenous cargo and EBs, we observed reduced axonal abundance and reduced secretion of DCV cargo, but not other KIF1A/UNC-104 cargo, in ebp-1 mutants. This reduction could be traced back to fewer exit events from the cell body, where EBP-1 colocalized with the DCV sorting machinery at the trans Golgi, suggesting that this is the site of EBP-1 function. In addition to its microtubule binding CH domain, mammalian EB1 interacted with mammalian KIF1A in an EBH domain dependent manner, and expression of mammalian EB1 or the EBH domain was sufficient to rescue DCV transport in ebp-1 mutants. Our results suggest a model in which kinesin-3 binding and microtubule binding by EBP-1 cooperate to transiently enrich the motor near sites of DCV biogenesis to promote motor-cargo association. In support of this model, tethering either EBP-1 or a kinesin-3 KIF1A/UNC-104 interacting domain from an unrelated protein to the Golgi restored the axonal abundance of DCV proteins in ebp-1 mutants. These results uncover an unexpected role for a microtubule associated protein and provide insight into how specific kinesin-3 cargo are delivered to the axon.},

Ubiquitylation not only directs the targeted destruction of tagged proteins by the 26 S proteasome, but it also modulates protein activities, protein\textendash protein interactions and subcellular localization. An understanding of the components involved in protein ubiquitylation (E1s, E2s and E3s) is essential to understand how specificity and regulation are conferred upon these pathways. Much of what we know about the catalytic mechanisms of protein ubiquitylation comes from structural studies of the proteins involved in this process. Indeed, structures of ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1s) and ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) have provided insight into their mechanistic details. E3s (ubiquitin ligases) contain most of the substrate specificity and regulatory elements required for protein ubiquitylation. Although several E3 structures are available, the specific mechanistic role of E3s is still unclear. This review will discuss the different types of ubiquitin signals and how they are generated. Recent advances in the field of protein ubiquitylation will be examined, including the mechanisms of E1, E2 and E3. In particular, we discuss the complexity of molecular recognition required to impose selectivity on substrate selection and topology of poly-ubiquitin chains.},

  abstract = {The Ubiquitin CODE constitutes a unique post-translational modification language relying on the covalent attachment of Ubiquitin (Ub) to substrates, with Ub serving as the minimum entity to generate a message that is translated into different cellular pathways. The creation of this message is brought about by the dedicated action of writers, erasers, and readers of the Ubiquitin CODE. This CODE is greatly expanded through the generation of polyUb chains of different architectures on substrates thus regulating their fate. Through additional post-translational modification by Ub-like proteins (UbL), hybrid Ub/UbL chains, which either alter the originally encrypted message or encode a completely new one, are formed. Hybrid Ub/UbL chains are generated under both stress or physiological conditions and seem to confer improved specificity and affinity toward their cognate receptors. In such a manner, their formation must play a specific, yet still undefined role in cellular signaling and thus understanding the UbCODE message is crucial. Here, we discuss the evidence for the existence of hybrid Ub/UbL chains in addition to the current understanding of its biology. The modification of Ub by another UbL complicates the deciphering of the spatial and temporal order of events warranting the development of a hybrid chain toolbox. We discuss this unmet need and expand upon the creation of tailored tools adapted from our previously established toolkit for the Ubiquitin Proteasome System to specifically target these hybrid Ub/UbL chains.}

Here we have investigated whether the Caenorhabditis elegans monomeric kinesin unc104 and the sea urchin heteromeric kinesin KRP85/95, two other members of the kinesin superfamily that function in membrane transport, are also processive. Both motors were fused to green fluorescent protein, and the fusion proteins were tested for processive ability using a single-molecule fluorescence imaging microscope. Neither unc104-GFP nor KRP85/95-GFP exhibited processive movement (detection limit {$\sim$}40 nm), although both motors were functional in multiple motor microtubule gliding assays (v = 1760 {$\pm$} 540 and 202 {$\pm$} 37 nm/s, respectively). Moreover, the ATP turnover rates (5.5 and 3.1 ATPs per motor domain per second, respectively) are too low to give rise to the observed microtubule gliding velocities, if only a single motor were driving transport with an 8 nm step per ATPase cycle. Instead, the results suggest that these motors have low duty cycles and that high processivity may not be required for efficient vesicle transport. Conventional kinesin's unusual processivity may be required for efficient transport of protein complexes that cannot carry multiple motors.}

Mutant analyses suggest that the primary motors for mitochondrial movement in larval motor axons are kinesin-1 (anterograde) and cytoplasmic dynein (retrograde), and interestingly that kinesin-1 is critical for retrograde transport by dynein. During transport, there was little evidence that force production by the two opposing motors was competitive, suggesting a mechanism for alternate coordination. Tests of the possible coordination factor P150Glued suggested that it indeed influenced both motors on axonal mitochondria, but there was no evidence that its function was critical for the motor coordination mechanism. Observation of organelle-filled axonal swellings (``organelle jams'' or ``clogs'') caused by kinesin and dynein mutations showed that mitochondria could move vigorously within and pass through them, indicating that they were not the simple steric transport blockades suggested previously. We speculate that axonal swellings may instead reflect sites of autophagocytosis of senescent mitochondria that are stranded in axons by retrograde transport failure; a protective process aimed at suppressing cell death signals and neurodegeneration.}

There, OSM-3 gradually replaces kinesin-II, yielding velocity profiles inconsistent with in vitro motility assays, and then drives transport to the ciliary tip. Dissociated kinesin-II motors undergo rapid turnaround and recycling to the ciliary base, whereas OSM-3 is recycled mainly to the handover zone. This reveals a functional differentiation in which the slower, less processive kinesin-II imports IFT trains into the cilium and OSM-3 drives their long-range transport, thereby optimizing cargo delivery.},

  abstract = {Huntingtin (HTT) is a scaffolding protein that recruits motor proteins to vesicular cargoes, enabling it to regulate kinesin-1, dynein, and myosin-VI-dependent transport. To maintain the native stoichiometry of HTT with its interacting partners, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to induce a phosphomimetic mutation of the endogenous HTT at S421 (HTT-S421D). Using single-particle tracking, optical tweezers, and immunofluorescence, we examined the effects of this mutation on the motility of early endosomes and lysosomes. In HTT-S421D cells, lysosomes exhibit longer displacements and higher processive fractions compared with wild-type (HTT-WT) cells. Kinesins and dyneins exert greater forces on early endosomes and lysosomes in cells expressing HTT-S421D. In addition, endosomes bind to microtubules faster and are more resistant to detachment under load. The recruitment of kinesins and dyneins to microtubules is enhanced in HTT-S421D cells. In contrast, overexpression of HTT had variable effects on the processivity, displacement, and directional bias of both early endosomes and lysosomes. These data indicate that phosphorylation of the endogenous HTT causes early endosomes and lysosomes to move longer distances and more processively by recruiting and activating both kinesin-1 and dynein.},

  abstract = {We identify the SUMO-Targeted Ubiquitin Ligase (STUbL) family of proteins and propose that STUbLs selectively ubiquitinate sumoylated proteins and proteins that contain SUMO-like domains (SLDs). STUbL recruitment to sumoylated/SLD proteins is mediated by tandem SUMO interaction motifs (SIMs) within the STUbLs N-terminus. STUbL-mediated ubiquitination maintains sumoylation pathway homeostasis by promoting target protein desumoylation and/or degradation. Thus, STUbLs establish a novel mode of communication between the sumoylation and ubiquitination pathways. STUbLs are evolutionarily conserved and include: Schizosaccharomyces pombe Slx8-Rfp (founding member), Homo sapiens RNF4, Dictyostelium discoideum MIP1 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Slx5?Slx8. Cells lacking Slx8-Rfp accumulate sumoylated proteins, display genomic instability, and are hypersensitive to genotoxic stress. These phenotypes are suppressed by deletion of the major SUMO ligase Pli1, demonstrating the specificity of STUbLs as regulators of sumoylated proteins. Notably, human RNF4 expression restores SUMO pathway homeostasis in fission yeast lacking Slx8-Rfp, underscoring the evolutionary functional conservation of STUbLs. The DNA repair factor Rad60 and its human homolog NIP45, which contain SLDs, are candidate STUbL targets. Consistently, Rad60 and Slx8-Rfp mutants have similar DNA repair defects.},

This work provides a mechanistic link between Wnt signaling and Kinesin-13 in establishing microtubule polarity in touch neurons of C. elegans., Neuronal polarization is facilitated by the formation of axons with parallel arrays of plus-end-out and dendrites with the nonuniform orientation of microtubules. In C. elegans, the posterior lateral microtubule (PLM) neuron is bipolar with its two processes growing along the anterior\textendash posterior axis under the guidance of Wnt signaling. Here we found that loss of the Kinesin-13 family microtubule-depolymerizing enzyme KLP-7 led to the ectopic extension of axon-like processes from the PLM cell body. Live imaging of the microtubules and axonal transport revealed mixed polarity of the microtubules in the short posterior process, which is dependent on both KLP-7 and the minus-end binding protein PTRN-1. KLP-7 is positively regulated in the posterior process by planar cell polarity components of Wnt involving rho-1/rock to induce mixed polarity of microtubules, whereas it is negatively regulated in the anterior process by the unc-73/ced-10 cascade to establish a uniform microtubule polarity. Our work elucidates how evolutionarily conserved Wnt signaling establishes the microtubule polarity in neurons through Kinesin-13.},

Although LIS1 binds the microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein and has been linked to dynein function in many experimental systems, its mechanism of action remains unclear. Here, we revealed its function in cargo-adapter\textendash mediated dynein activation in the model organism Aspergillus nidulans. Specifically, we found that overexpressed cargo adapter HookA (Hook in A. nidulans) missing its cargo-binding domain ({$\Delta$}C-HookA) causes dynein and its regulator dynactin to relocate from the microtubule plus ends to the minus ends, and this relocation requires LIS1 and its binding protein, NudE. Astonishingly, the requirement for LIS1 or NudE can be bypassed to a significant extent by mutations that prohibit dynein from forming an autoinhibited conformation in which the motor domains of the dynein dimer are held close together. Our results suggest a novel mechanism of LIS1 action that promotes the switch of dynein from the autoinhibited state to an open state to facilitate dynein activation.}

Understanding how motors generate force as a team is therefore fundamentally important but is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate optical trapping at single-molecule resolution inside cells to quantify force generation by motor teams driving single phagosomes. In remarkable paradox, strong kinesins fail to work collectively, whereas weak and detachment-prone dyneins team up to generate large forces that tune linearly in strength and persistence with dynein number. Based on experimental evidence, we propose that leading dyneins in~a load-carrying team take short steps, whereas trailing dyneins take larger steps. Dyneins in such a team bunch close together and therefore share load better to overcome low/intermediate loads. Up against higher load, dyneins ``catch bond'' tenaciously to the microtubule, but kinesins detach rapidly. Dynein therefore appears uniquely adapted to work in large teams, which may explain how this motor executes bewilderingly diverse cellular processes.},

  abstract = {Despite massive fluctuations in its internal triglyceride content, the liver secretes triglyceride under tight homeostatic control. This buffering function is most visible after fasting, when liver triglyceride increases manyfold but circulating serum triglyceride barely fluctuates. How the liver controls triglyceride secretion is unknown, but is fundamentally important for lipid and energy homeostasis in animals. Here we find an unexpected cellular and molecular mechanism behind such control. We show that kinesin motors are recruited to triglyceride-rich lipid droplets (LDs) in the liver by the GTPase ARF1, which is a key activator of lipolysis. This recruitment is activated by an insulin-dependent pathway and therefore responds to fed/fasted states of the animal. In fed state, ARF1 and kinesin appear on LDs, consequently transporting LDs to the periphery of hepatocytes where the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (sER) is present. Because the lipases that catabolize LDs in hepatocytes reside on the sER, LDs can now be catabolized efficiently to provide triglyceride for lipoprotein assembly and secretion from the sER. Upon fasting, insulin is lowered to remove ARF1 and kinesin from LDs, thus down-regulating LD transport and sER\textendash LD contacts. This tempers triglyceride availabiity for very low density lipoprotein assembly and allows homeostatic control of serum triglyceride in a fasted state. We further show that kinesin knockdown inhibits hepatitis-C virus replication in hepatocytes, likely because translated viral proteins are unable to transfer from the ER to LDs.}

Conjugation with the small polypeptide ubiquitin is a signal for lysosomal sorting. Here we show that the hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate, Hrs, is involved in the endosomal sorting of ubiquitinated membrane proteins. Hrs contains a clathrin-binding domain, and by electron microscopy we show that Hrs localizes to flat clathrin lattices on early endosomes. We demonstrate that Hrs binds directly to ubiquitin by way of a ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM), and that ubiquitinated proteins localize specifically to Hrs- and clathrin-containing microdomains. Whereas endocytosed transferrin receptors fail to colocalize with Hrs and rapidly recycle to the cell surface, transferrin receptors that are fused to ubiquitin interact with Hrs, localize to Hrs- and clathrin-containing microdomains and are sorted to the degradative pathway. Overexpression of Hrs strongly and specifically inhibits recycling of ubiquitinated transferrin receptors by a mechanism that requires a functional UIM. We conclude that Hrs sorts ubiquitinated membrane proteins into clathrin-coated microdomains of early endosomes, thereby preventing their recycling to the cell surface.},

However, the biochemical evidence for this balance and coordination is largely lacking. Leveraging our recent discovery of a neuronal-specific 20S membrane proteasome complex (NMP), we began exploring how neuronal activity regulates its function. Here, we found that the NMP degrades exclusively a large fraction of ribosome-associated nascent polypeptides that are being newly synthesized during neuronal stimulation. Using deep-coverage and global mass spectrometry, we identified the nascent protein substrates of the NMP, which included products encoding immediate-early genes, such as c-Fos and Npas4. Intriguingly, we found that turnover of nascent polypeptides and not full-length proteins through the NMP occurred independent of canonical ubiquitylation pathways. We propose that these findings generally define a neuronal activity-induced protein homeostasis program of coordinated protein synthesis and degradation through the NMP.},

In the eat-4(ky5) loss-of-function worms, there is presumably insufficient glutamate available for sustained transmission. In the experiments reported here eat-4 worms showed no differences from wild-type in the magnitude of response to a single tap, indicating that the neural circuit underlying the response was intact and functional in the mutant worms. However, wheneat-4 worms were given repeated taps the resulting habituation was different from that seen in wild-type worms:eat-4 worms habituate more rapidly and recover more slowly than wild-type worms at all interstimulus intervals tested. In addition, eat-4 worms do not show dishabituation. The same transgene rescues pharyngeal activity defects and both the habituation and dishabituation deficits seen in theeat-4 worms. Our results suggest that neurotransmitter regulation plays a role in habituation and may play a role in dishabituation.},

When cytoplasmic dynein was acutely inhibited, the bi-directional transport of microtubules in the axon was disrupted in both directions, after which minus-end-out microtubules accumulated in the axon over time. Computational modeling revealed that dynein-mediated transport of microtubules can establish and preserve a predominantly plus-end-out microtubule pattern as per the details of the experimental findings, but only if a kinesin motor and a static cross-linker protein are also at play. Consistent with the predictions of the model, partial depletion of TRIM46, a protein that cross-links axonal microtubules in a manner that influences their polarity orientation, leads to an increase in microtubule transport.},

  abstract = {Abstract: KIF1A, a kinesin-related motor protein that transports pre-synaptic vesicles in neurons, was originally presumed to translocate along microtubules (MT) as a monomer. Protein structure predictions from its amino acid sequence failed to identify the long coiled-coil domains typical of kinesins, which led researchers to believe it does not oligomerize into the canonical kinesin dimer. However, mounting evidence using recombinant chimeric protein indicates that KIF1A, like conventional kinesin, requires dimerization for fast, unidirectional processive movement along MTs. Because these studies are somewhat indirect, we wished to test the oligomerization state of native KIF1A, and to compare that to full-length recombinant protein. We have performed hydrodynamic analyses to determine the molecular weights of the respective complexes. Our results indicate that most native KIF1A is soluble and indeed monomeric, but recombinant KIF1A is a dimer. MT-binding studies also showed that native KIF1A did not bind to MTs in either the presence of AMP-PNP, apyrase, or adenosine triphosphate (ATP), but recombinant KIF1A bound to MTs most stably in the presence of ATP, indicating very different motor functional states. To further characterize KIF1A's dimerization potential, we prepared peptides corresponding to the neck domains of MmKIF1A and CeUnc104, and by circular dichroism spectroscopy compared these peptides for their ability to form coiled-coils. Interestingly, both MmKIF1A and CeUnc104 neck peptides formed homodimeric coiled-coils, with the MmKIF1A neck coiled-coil exhibiting the greater stability. Collectively, from our data and from previous studies, we predict that native KIF1A can exist as both an inactive monomer and an active homodimer formed in part through its neck coiled-coil domain.},

Here, we identify a C. elegans mutant, ric-7, in which mitochondria are unable to exit the neuron cell bodies, similar to the kinesin-1/unc-116 mutant. When axons lacking mitochondria are cut with a laser they rapidly degenerate. Some neurons even spontaneously degenerate in ric-7 mutants. Degeneration can be suppressed by forcing mitochondria into the axons of the mutants. The protective effect of mitochondria is also observed in the wild type: a majority of axon fragments containing a mitochondrion survive axotomy, whereas those lacking mitochondria degenerate. Thus, mitochondria are not required for axon degeneration and serve a protective role in C. elegans axons.},

We polymerized microtubules with protofilaments that ran either parallel to the microtubule's long axis or that ran along shallow helical paths around the cylindrical surface of the microtubule. When gliding across a kinesin-coated surface, the former microtubules did not rotate. The latter microtubules, those with supertwisted protofilaments, did rotate; the pitch and handedness of the rotation accorded with the supertwist measured by electron cryo-microscopy. The results show that kinesin follows a path parallel to the protofilaments with high fidelity. This implies that the distance between consecutive kinesin-binding sites along the microtubule must be an integral multiple of 4.1 nm, the tubulin monomer spacing along the protofilament, or a multiple of 8.2 nm, the dimer spacing.}

Immunostaining for KLP68D and ribonucleic acid in situ hybridization for KLP64D demonstrated their preferential expression in cholinergic neurons. KLP68D was also found to accumulate in cholinergic neurons in axonal obstructions caused by the loss of kinesin light chain. Mutations in the KLP64D gene cause uncoordinated sluggish movement and death, and reduce transport of choline acetyltransferase from cell bodies to the synapse. The inviability of KLP64D mutations can be rescued by expression of mammalian KIF3A. Together, these data suggest that kinesin-II is required for the axonal transport of a soluble enzyme, choline acetyltransferase, in a specific subset of neurons in Drosophila. Furthermore, the data lead to the conclusion that the cargo transport requirements of different classes of neurons may lead to upregulation of specific pathways of axonal transport.}

Recent studies have shown that ubiquitination of I{$\kappa$}B{$\alpha$} is carried out by a ubiquitin-ligase enzyme complex called SCF{$\beta$}TrCP. Here we show that Nedd8 modification of the Cul-1 component of SCF{$\beta$}TrCP is important for function of SCF{$\beta$}TrCP in ubiquitination of I{$\kappa$}B{$\alpha$}. In cells, Nedd8-conjugated Cul-1 was complexed with two substrates of SCF{$\beta$}TrCP, phosphorylated I{$\kappa$}B{$\alpha$} and {$\beta$}-catenin, indicating that Nedd8\textendash Cul-1 conjugates are part of SCF{$\beta$}TrCP in vivo. Although only a minute fraction of total cellular Cul-1 is modified by Nedd8, the Cul-1 associated with ectopically expressed {$\beta$}TrCP was highly enriched for the Nedd8-conjugated form. Moreover, optimal ubiquitination of I{$\kappa$}B{$\alpha$} required Nedd8 and the Nedd8-conjugating enzyme, Ubc12. The site of Nedd8 ligation to Cul-1 is essential, as SCF{$\beta$}TrCPcontaining a K720R mutant of Cul-1 only weakly supported I{$\kappa$}B{$\alpha$} ubiquitination compared to SCF{$\beta$}TrCP containing WT Cul-1, suggesting that the Nedd8 ligation of Cul-1 affects the ubiquitination activity of SCF{$\beta$}TrCP. These observations provide a functional link between the highly related ubiquitin and Nedd8 pathways of protein modification and show how they operate together to selectively target the signal-dependent degradation of I{$\kappa$}B{$\alpha$}.},

In this Review, we focus on how motors and their cargo adaptors regulate positioning of cargoes from the earliest stages of endocytosis and through the two main intracellular itineraries: (1) degradation at the lysosome or (2) recycling back to the plasma membrane. In vitro and cellular (in vivo) studies on cargo transport thus far have typically focussed independently on either the motor proteins and adaptors, or membrane trafficking. Here, we will discuss recent studies to highlight what is known about the regulation of endosomal vesicle positioning and transport by motors and cargo adaptors. We also emphasise that in vitro and cellular studies are often performed at different scales, from single molecules to whole organelles, with the aim to provide a perspective on the unified principles of motor-driven cargo trafficking in living cells that can be learned from these differing scales.}

Current models postulate that directional trafficking is governed by known biophysical properties of these motors\textemdash kinesins generally move to the plus ends of microtubules in the cell periphery, whereas cytoplasmic dynein moves to the minus ends in the cell center. However, these models are insufficient to explain how polarized protein trafficking to subcellular domains is accomplished. We show that the kinesin-1 cargo protein JNK-interacting protein 1 (JIP1) is localized to only a subset of neurites in cultured neuronal cells. The mechanism of polarized trafficking appears to involve the preferential recognition of microtubules containing specific posttranslational modifications (PTMs) by the kinesin-1 motor domain. Using a genetic approach to eliminate specific PTMs, we show that the loss of a single modification, {$\alpha$}-tubulin acetylation at Lys-40, influences the binding and motility of kinesin-1 in vitro. In addition, pharmacological treatments that increase microtubule acetylation cause a redirection of kinesin-1 transport of JIP1 to nearly all neurite tips in vivo. These results suggest that microtubule PTMs are important markers of distinct microtubule populations and that they act to control motor-protein trafficking.},

Activities of opposing MT motors produce bidirectional movement of membrane organelles and cytoplasmic particles along MT transport tracks. Directionality of MT-based transport might be controlled by a protein complex that determines which motor type is active at any given moment of time, or determined by the outcome of a tug-of-war between MT motors dragging cargo organelles in opposite directions. However, evidence in support of each mechanisms of regulation is based mostly on the results of theoretical analyses or indirect experimental data. Here, we test whether the direction of movement of membrane organelles in vivo can be controlled by the tug-of-war between opposing MT motors alone, by attaching a large number of kinesin-1 motors to organelles transported by dynein to minus-ends of MTs. We find that recruitment of kinesin significantly reduces the length and velocity of minus-end-directed dynein-dependent MT runs, leading to a reversal of the overall direction of dynein-driven organelles in vivo. Therefore, in the absence of external regulators tug-of-war between opposing MT motors alone is sufficient to determine the directionality of MT transport in vivo.},

TRIzol (or TRI Reagent) is a monophasic solution of phenol and guanidinium isothiocyanate that simultaneously solubilizes biological material and denatures protein. After solubilization, the addition of chloroform causes phase separation (much like extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol), where protein is extracted to the organic phase, DNA resolves at the interface, and RNA remains in the aqueous phase. Therefore, RNA, DNA, and protein can be purified from a single sample (hence, the name TRIzol). TRIzol extraction is also an effective method for isolating small RNAs, such as microRNAs, piwi-associated RNAs, or endogeneous, small interfering RNAs. However, TRIzol is expensive and RNA pellets can be difficult to resuspend. Thus, the use of TRIzol is not recommend when regular phenol extraction is practical.},

From double-labelling experiments using antibodies against tyrosinated, detryrosinated, or acetylated alpha-tubulin, it was found that the three different isoforms were differentially localised in neurites and growth cones. Detyrosinated and acetylated forms of alpha-tubulin were in the main restricted to the neurites extending no further than the base of the growth cones. Tyrosinated alpha-tubulin was, however, distributed throughout the body of the growth cone and into the base of some microspikes. Following treatment with taxol to promote microtubule assembly, detyrosinated and acetylated alpha-tubulins were found to be colocalised with tyrosinated alpha-tubulins throughout the growth cones of all cells examined. These results would be consistent with axonal transport of tyrosinated alpha-tubulin followed by assembly in the growth cone and subsequent detyrosination and acetylation. In addition the presence of unmodified alpha-tubulin in the growth cone may be necessary for the provision of labile microtubules for growth cone motility and extension.},

Addition of 2-deoxyglucose and dinitrophenol (agents that efficiently deplete cellular ATP) to the growth medium of these cells inhibited ODC degradation. In contrast, chloroquine and leupeptin, inhibitors of intralysosomal proteolysis, did not affect ODC degradation. Shifting ts85 cells to 42 degrees C (a non-permissive temperature that inhibited conjugation of ubiquitin to target proteins) did not prevent ODC degradation.

We show that FAT10 gets conjugated to Parkin and mediates its degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. Parkin binds to the E2 enzyme of FAT10 (USE1), auto-FAT10ylates itself, and facilitates FAT10ylation of the Parkin substrate Mitofusin2 in~vitro and in cells, thus identifying Parkin as a FAT10 E3 ligase. On mitochondrial depolarization, FAT10ylation of Parkin inhibits its activation and ubiquitin-ligase activity causing impairment of mitophagy progression and aggravation of rotenone-mediated death of dopaminergic neuronal cells. In conclusion, FAT10ylation inhibits Parkin and mitophagy rendering FAT10 a likely inflammation-induced exacerbating factor and potential drug target for Parkinson's disease.},

  abstract = {Slow axonal transport conveys cytoskeletal proteins from cell body to axon tip. This transport provides the axon with the architectural elements that are required to generate and maintain its elongate shape and also generates forces within the axon that are necessary for axon growth and navigation. The mechanisms of cytoskeletal transport in axons are unknown. One hypothesis states that cytoskeletal proteins are transported within the axon as polymers. We tested this hypothesis by visualizing individual cytoskeletal polymers in living axons and determining whether they undergo vectorial movement. We focused on neurofilaments in axons of cultured sympathetic neurons because individual neurofilaments in these axons can be visualized by optical microscopy. Cultured sympathetic neurons were infected with recombinant adenovirus containing a construct encoding a fusion protein combining green fluorescent protein (GFP) with the heavy neurofilament protein subunit (NFH). The chimeric GFP\textendash NFH coassembled with endogenous neurofilaments. Time lapse imaging revealed that individual GFP\textendash NFH-labeled neurofilaments undergo vigorous vectorial transport in the axon in both anterograde and retrograde directions but with a strong anterograde bias. NF transport in both directions exhibited a broad spectrum of rates with averages of {$\approx$}0.6\textendash 0.7 {$\mu$}m/sec. However, movement was intermittent, with individual neurofilaments pausing during their transit within the axon. Some NFs either moved or paused for the most of the time they were observed, whereas others were intermediate in behavior. On average, neurofilaments spend at most 20\% of the time moving and rest of the time paused. These results establish that the slow axonal transport machinery conveys neurofilaments.},

Here, we use live-cell imaging to visualize and quantify the axonal transport of three SCb proteins, {$\alpha$}-synuclein, synapsin-I, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in cultured hippocampal neurons, and directly compare their transport to synaptophysin, a prototypical FC protein. All three SCb proteins move rapidly but infrequently with pauses during transit, unlike synaptophysin, which moves much more frequently and persistently. By simultaneously visualizing the transport of proteins at high temporal and spatial resolution, we show that the dynamics of {$\alpha$}-synuclein transport are distinct from those of synaptophysin but similar to other SCb proteins. Our observations of the cotransport of multiple SCb proteins in single axons suggest that they move as multiprotein complexes. These studies offer novel mechanistic insights into SCb and provide tools for further investigating its role in disease processes.},

  abstract = {High concentration of cytoskeletal filaments, organelles, and proteins along with the space constraints due to the axon's narrow geometry lead inevitably to intracellular physical crowding along the axon of a neuron. Local cargo movement is essential for maintaining steady cargo transport in the axon, and this may be impeded by physical crowding. Molecular motors that mediate active transport share movement mechanisms that allow them to bypass physical crowding present on microtubule tracks. Many neurodegenerative diseases, irrespective of how they are initiated, show increased physical crowding owing to the greater number of stalled organelles and structural changes associated with the cytoskeleton. Increased physical crowding may be a significant factor in slowing cargo transport to synapses, contributing to disease progression and culminating in the dying back of the neuronal process. This review explores the idea that physical crowding can impede cargo movement along the neuronal process. We examine the sources of physical crowding and strategies used by molecular motors that might enable cargo to circumvent physically crowded locations. Finally, we describe sub-cellular changes in neurodegenerative diseases that may alter physical crowding and discuss the implications of such changes on cargo movement.},

Neurons make use of this localized protein synthesis during initial growth, regeneration and functional maintenance of their axons. Although the first evidence for protein synthesis in axons dates back to 1960s, improved methodologies, including the ability to isolate axons to purity, highly sensitive RNA detection methods and imaging approaches, have shed new light on the complexity of the transcriptome of the axon and how it is regulated. Moreover, these efforts are now uncovering new roles for locally synthesized proteins in neurological diseases and injury responses. In this Cell Science at a Glance article and the accompanying poster, we provide an overview of how axonal mRNA transport and translation are regulated, and discuss their emerging links to neurological disorders and neural repair.}

The Caenorhabditis elegans genome has a single KHC, encoded by the unc-116 gene, and two KLCs, encoded by the klc-1 and klc-2 genes. We show here that UNC-116/KHC and KLC-2 form a complex orthologous to conventional kinesin-1. KLC-2 also binds UNC-16, the C. elegans JIP3/JSAP1 JNK-signaling scaffold protein, and the UNC-14 RUN domain protein. The localization of UNC-16 and UNC-14 depends on kinesin-1 (UNC-116 and KLC-2). Furthermore, mutations in unc-16, klc-2, unc-116, and unc-14 all alter the localization of cargos containing synaptic vesicle markers. Double mutant analysis is consistent with these four genes functioning in the same pathway. Our data support a model whereby UNC-16 and UNC-14 function together as kinesin-1 cargos and regulators for the transport or localization of synaptic vesicle components.}

Using the lysosome adaptor SKIP (also known as PLEKHM2) as model cargo, we show that the kinesin heavy chains (KHCs), in addition to the kinesin light chains (KLCs), can recognize tryptophan-acidic-binding determinants on the cargo when presented in the context of an extended KHC-interacting domain. Mutational separation of KHC and KLC binding shows that both interactions are important for SKIP\textendash kinesin-1 interaction in vitro and that KHC binding is important for lysosome transport in vivo. However, in the absence of KLCs, SKIP can only bind to KHC when autoinhibition is relieved, suggesting that the KLCs gate access to the KHCs. We propose a model whereby tryptophan-acidic cargo is first recognized by KLCs, resulting in destabilization of KHC autoinhibition. This primary event then makes accessible a second SKIP-binding site on the KHC C-terminal tail that is adjacent to the autoinhibitory IAK region. Thus, cargo recognition and concurrent activation of kinesin-1 proceed in hierarchical stepwise fashion driven by a dynamic network of inter- and intra-molecular interactions.}

  abstract = {How the opposing activity of kinesin and dynein motors generates polarized distribution of organelles inside cells is poorly understood and hotly debated [1, 2]. Possible explanations include stochastic mechanical competition [3, 4], coordinated regulation by motor-associated proteins [5, 6, 7], mechanical activation of motors [8], and lipid-induced organization [9]. Here, we address this question by using phagocytosed latex beads to generate early phagosomes (EPs) that move bidirectionally along microtubules (MTs) in an in~vitro assay [9]. Dynein/kinesin activity on individual EPs is recorded as real-time force generation of the motors against an optical trap. Activity of one class of motors frequently coincides with, or is rapidly followed by opposite motors. This leads to frequent and rapid reversals of EPs in the trap. Remarkably, the choice between dynein and kinesin can be explained by the tossing of a coin. Opposing motors therefore appear to function stochastically and independently of each other, as also confirmed by observing no effect on kinesin function when dynein is inhibited on the EPs. A simple binomial probability calculation based on the geometry of EP-microtubule contact explains the observed activity of dynein and kinesin on phagosomes. This understanding of intracellular transport in terms of a hypothetical coin, if it holds true for other cargoes, provides a conceptual framework to explain the polarized localization of organelles inside cells.},

A key regulator of this process is MCAK, the mitotic centromere-associated kinesin. During mitosis the activity and localization of MCAK are regulated by mitotic key kinases including Plk1 and Aurora B. We show here that S621 in the MCAK's C-terminal domain is the major phosphorylation site for Plk1. This phosphorylation regulates MCAK's stability and facilitates its recognition by the ubiquitin/proteasome dependent APC/CCdc20 pathway leading to its D-box dependent degradation in mitosis. While phosphorylation of S621 does not directly affect its microtubule depolymerising activity, loss of Plk1 phosphorylation on S621 indirectly enhances its depolymerization activity in vivo by stabilizing MCAK, leading to an increased level of protein. Interfering with phosphorylation at S621 causes spindle formation defects and chromosome misalignments. Therefore, this study suggests a new mechanism by which Plk1 regulates MCAK: by regulating its degradation and hence controlling its turnover in mitosis.},

Different experimental and physiological conditions can induce these organelles to move to the cell periphery by a mechanism implying a plus-end-directed microtubule-motor protein (a kinesin-like motor). The responsible kinesin-superfamily protein, however, is unknown. We have identified a new mouse isoform of the kinesin superfamily, KIF2?, an alternatively spliced isoform of the known, neuronal kinesin, KIF2. Developmental expression pattern and cell-type analysis in vivo and in vitro reveal that KIF2? is abundant at early developmental stages of the hippocampus but is then downregulated in differentiated neuronal cells, and it is mainly or uniquely expressed in non-neuronal cells while KIF2 remains exclusively neuronal. Electron microscopy of mouse fibroblasts and immunofluorescence of KIF2?-transiently-transfected fibroblasts show KIF2 and KIF2? primarily associated with lysosomes, and this association can be disrupted by detergent treatment. In KIF2?-overexpressing cells, lysosomes (labeled with anti-lysosome-associated membrane protein-1) become abnormally large and peripherally located at some distance from their usual perinuclear positions. Overexpression of KIF2 or KIF2? does not change the size or distribution of early, late and recycling endosomes nor does overexpression of different kinesin superfamily proteins result in changes in lysosome size or positioning. These results implicate KIF2? as a motor responsible for the peripheral translocation of lysosomes.},

Whereas PARKIN is recruited to the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) upon depolarization via PINK1 action and can ubiquitylate porin, mitofusin and Miro proteins on the MOM, the full repertoire of PARKIN substrates--the PARKIN-dependent ubiquitylome--remains poorly defined. Here we use quantitative diGly capture proteomics (diGly) to elucidate the ubiquitylation site specificity and topology of PARKIN-dependent target modification in response to mitochondrial depolarization. Hundreds of dynamically regulated ubiquitylation sites in dozens of proteins were identified, with strong enrichment for MOM proteins, indicating that PARKIN dramatically alters the ubiquitylation status of the mitochondrial proteome. Using complementary interaction proteomics, we found depolarization-dependent PARKIN association with numerous MOM targets, autophagy receptors, and the proteasome. Mutation of the PARKIN active site residue C431, which has been found mutated in Parkinson's disease patients, largely disrupts these associations. Structural and topological analysis revealed extensive conservation of PARKIN-dependent ubiquitylation sites on cytoplasmic domains in vertebrate and Drosophila melanogaster MOM proteins. These studies provide a resource for understanding how the PINK1-PARKIN pathway re-sculpts the proteome to support mitochondrial homeostasis.},

We have found that all single and double Rab3 knock-out mice are viable and fertile. Most triple Rab3 knock-out mice perish whenever Rab3A is one of the three deleted proteins, whereas all triple knock-out mice that express Rab3A are viable and fertile. Finally, all quadruple knock-out mice die shortly after birth. Quadruple Rab3 KO mice initially develop normally and are born alive but succumb to respiratory failure. Rab3-deficient mice display no apparent changes in synapse structure or brain composition except for a loss of rabphilin, a Rab3-binding protein. Analysis of cultured hippocampal neurons from quadruple knock-out mice uncovered no significant change in spontaneous or sucrose-evoked release but an approximately 30\% decrease in evoked responses. This decrease was caused by a decline in the synaptic and the vesicular release probabilities, suggesting that Rab3 proteins are essential for the normal regulation of Ca2+-triggered synaptic vesicle exocytosis but not for synaptic vesicle exocytosis as such. Our data show that Rab3 is required for survival in mice and that the four Rab3 proteins are functionally redundant in this role. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that Rab3 is not in itself essential for synaptic membrane traffic but functions to modulate the basic release machinery.},

Many of these newly identified linkers are scaffolds for signaling pathways, and mounting evidence now indicates that kinesins transport pre-assembled signaling modules as vesicular cargo. These findings bring together two fields, signal transduction and molecular motors, and lead to a deeper understanding of the interplay between trafficking, localization and intercellular communication.}

  abstract = {The longest fibers of the main optic tract reach the upper layers of the superior colliculus (SC) of the midbrain. Destruction of this terminal area in newborn hamsters caused striking anomalies in the distribution of the optic tract, studied after the animals were fully grown. Evidence of termination was found in areas normally devoid of such termination: in the remaining tissue of the colliculus and in the thalamic nucleus lateralis posterior (LP). An abnormally high density of termination was found in part of the ventral nucleus of the lateral geniculate body. These thalamic regions normally receive connections from SC. Retinofugal axons could also be induced to terminate in the medial geniculate body of the thalamus if the brachium of the inferior colliculus, which normally carries auditory information to this cell group, was ablated at birth together with the lesion of SC.If the superficial layers of SC were destroyed unilaterally at birth, axons from the eye contralateral to the lesion not only reached the area of early damage, but also formed an abnormal decussation, crossing the tectal midline to terminate in the medial zone of the undamaged colliculus. Axons from the two eyes competed for terminal space in this intact colliculus, for they terminated in a nonoverlapping manner, and if the axons from the eye contralateral to the remaining SC were eliminated at birth, the anomalously recrossing axons increased in quantity and spread across the entire SC on the 'wrong' side of the midbrain. Hamsters with such an anomaly showed wrong-direction turning in response to visual stimuli in a large part of the visual field.The less the amount of termination found in SC, the greater was the amount in LP. Thus, optic tract axons showed a 'pruning effect' which may be attributed to a tendency for axons to conserve the quantity of their terminal arborizations. The pruning effect alone may account for the hypertrophy we found, after early SC lesions, of the dorsal terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract. The tendency to invade vacated terminal space may be sufficient to account for an effect of early unilateral eye removal, namely, a pronounced increase in an ipsilateral retinal projection to the medial terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract.The greatest alterations in axonal projections were seen when the two effects, competition and pruning, seemed to act jointly. Additional factors may have to be considered in fully explaining such neuroplasticity; some of these have been suggested.}

  abstract = {Obstacles on the surface of microtubules can lead to defective cargo transport, proposed to play a role in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's. However, little is known about how motor proteins, which follow individual microtubule protofilaments (such as kinesin-1), deal with obstacles on the molecular level. Here, we used rigor-binding mutants of kinesin-1 as roadblocks to permanently obstruct individual microtubule binding sites and studied the movement of individual kinesin-1 motors by single-molecule fluorescence and dark-field scattering microscopy in~vitro. In the presence of roadblocks, kinesin-1 often stopped for {$\sim$}0.4~s before either detaching or continuing to move, whereby the latter circumvention events occurred in {$>$}30\% after a stopping event. Consequently, and in agreement with numerical simulations, the mean velocity, mean run length, and mean dwell time of the kinesin-1 motors decreased upon increasing the roadblock density. Tracking individual kinesin-1 motors labeled by 40~nm gold particles with 6~nm spatial and 1~ms temporal precision revealed that {$\sim$}70\% of the circumvention events were associated with significant transverse shifts perpendicular to the axis of the microtubule. These side-shifts, which occurred with equal likelihood to the left and right, were accompanied by a range of longitudinal shifts suggesting that roadblock circumvention involves the unbinding and rebinding of the motors. Thus, processive motors, which commonly follow individual protofilaments in the absence of obstacles, appear to possess intrinsic circumvention mechanisms. These mechanisms were potentially optimized by evolution for the motor's specific intracellular tasks and environments.},

Subsequent work, however, has revealed diversity in the oligomeric state of different kinesin-2 motors owing to the combinatorial heterodimerization of its subunits and the coexistence of both heterotrimeric and homodimeric kinesin-2 motors in some cells. Although the functional significance of the homo- versus heteromeric organization of kinesin-2 motor subunits and the role of KAP remain uncertain, functional studies suggest that cooperation between different types of kinesin-2 motors or between kinesin-2 and a member of a different motor family can generate diverse patterns of anterograde intracellular transport. Moreover, despite being restricted to ciliated eukaryotes, kinesin-2 motors are now known to drive diverse transport events outside cilia. Here, I review the organization, assembly, phylogeny, biological functions, and motility mechanism of this diverse family of intracellular transport motors.},

Therefore, cellular systems for distributing Tau molecules are needed. This review discusses different mechanisms that have been proposed to contribute to the dispersion of Tau molecules in neurons. They include (1) directed transport along microtubules as cargo of tubulin complexes and/or motor proteins, (2) diffusion, either through the cytosolic space or along microtubules, and (3) mRNA-based mechanisms such as transport of Tau mRNA into axons and local translation. Diffusion along the microtubule lattice or through the cytosol appear to be the major mechanisms for axonal distribution of Tau protein in the short-to-intermediate range over distances of up to a millimetre. The high diffusion coefficients ensure that Tau can distribute evenly throughout the axonal volume as well as along microtubules. Motor protein-dependent transport of Tau dominates over longer distances and time scales. At low near-physiological levels, Tau is co-transported along with short microtubules from cell bodies into axons by cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin family members at rates of slow axonal transport.},

It was previously reported that Kin3, a member of the kinesin-3 family, and cytoplasmic dynein mediate bidirectional motility of EEs in the fungus Ustilago maydis. We fused the green fluorescent protein to the endogenous dynein heavy chain and the kin3 gene and visualized both motors and their cargo in the living cells. Whereas kinesin-3 was found on anterograde and retrograde EEs, dynein motors localize only to retrograde organelles. Live cell imaging shows that binding of retrograde moving dynein to anterograde moving endosomes changes the transport direction of the organelles. When dynein is leaving the EEs, the organelles switch back to anterograde kinesin-3\textendash based motility. Quantitative photobleaching and comparison with nuclear pores as an internal calibration standard show that single dynein motors and four to five kinesin-3 motors bind to the organelles. These data suggest that dynein controls kinesin-3 activity on the EEs and thereby determines the long-range motility behavior of the organelles.}

However, the initial signals that establish cellular asymmetry and the pathways that subsequently translate it into structural changes remain to be elucidated. Here we show that localization of the GTPase Rap1B to the tip of a single neurite is a decisive step in determining which neurite becomes the axon. Using GTPase mutants and RNA interference, we found that Rap1B is necessary and sufficient to initiate the development of axons upstream of Cdc42 and the Par complex.},

In vitro reconstitution assays demonstrate that MCAK and its closely related orthologs Kif2a and Kif2b become efficiently polyubiquitylated by neddylated SCFFbxw5 and Cdc34, without requiring preceding modifications. In cells, SCFFbxw5 ~targets MCAK for proteasomal degradation predominantly during G2 . While this seems largely dispensable for mitotic progression, loss of Fbxw5 leads to increased MCAK levels at basal bodies and impairs ciliogenesis in the following G1 /G0 , which can be rescued by concomitant knockdown of MCAK, Kif2a or Kif2b. We thus propose a novel regulatory event of ciliogenesis that begins already within the G2 phase of the preceding cell cycle.},

We report an alternative E3-E3 tagging cascade: many cellular NEDD8-modified CRLs associate with a mechanistically distinct thioester-forming RBR-type E3, ARIH1, and rely on ARIH1 to directly add the first UB and, in~some cases, multiple additional individual monoubiquitin modifications onto CRL client substrates. Our data define ARIH1 as a component of the human CRL system, demonstrate that ARIH1 can efficiently and specifically mediate monoubiquitylation of several CRL substrates, and establish principles for how two distinctive E3s can reciprocally control each other for simultaneous and joint regulation of substrate ubiquitylation. These studies have broad implications for CRL-dependent proteostasis and mechanisms of E3-mediated UB ligation.},

FCS data are conventionally modeled with a finite number of diffusing components and fit with a least-square fitting algorithm. This approach is inadequate for analyzing data obtained from highly heterogeneous systems. We introduce a Maximum Entropy Method based fitting routine (MEMFCS) that analyzes FCS data in terms of a quasicontinuous distribution of diffusing components, and also guarantees a maximally wide distribution that is consistent with the data. We verify that for a homogeneous specimen (green fluorescent protein in dilute aqueous solution), both MEMFCS and conventional fitting yield similar results. Further, we incorporate an appropriate goodness of fit criterion in MEMFCS. We show that for errors estimated from a large number of repeated measurements, the reduced {$\chi$}2 value in MEMFCS analysis does approach unity. We find that the theoretical prediction for errors in FCS experiments overestimates the actual error, but can be empirically modified to serve as a guide for estimating the goodness of the fit where reliable error estimates are unavailable. Finally, we compare the performance of MEMFCS with that of a conventional fitting routine for analyzing simulated data describing a highly heterogeneous distribution containing 41 diffusing species. Both methods fit the data well. However, the conventional fit fails to reproduce the essential features of the input distribution, whereas MEMFCS yields a distribution close to the actual input.},

In this paper, we show that the mixed lineage kinase dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) selectively regulates the JNK-based stress response pathway to mediate axon degeneration and neuronal apoptosis without influencing other aspects of JNK signaling. This specificity is dependent on interaction of DLK with the scaffolding protein JIP3 to form a specialized JNK signaling complex. Local activation of DLK-based signaling in the axon results in phosphorylation of c-Jun and apoptosis after redistribution of JNK to the cell body. In contrast, regulation of axon degeneration by DLK is c-Jun independent and mediated by distinct JNK substrates. DLK-null mice displayed reduced apoptosis in multiple neuronal populations during development, demonstrating that prodegenerative DLK signaling is required in vivo.}

Such `en passant' terminals are never seen in normal mature rat muscle, where all synaptic sites form at the true termination of axonal branches. These terminals thus appear to be a transient feature of developing neuromuscular relations. Analogous structures may arise in mature muscle when axons undergo ultraterminal sprouting in response to paralysis or partial denervation.

We show that axonal RP translation is regulated through a sequence motif, CUIC, that forms an RNA-loop structure in the region immediately upstream of the initiation codon. Using imaging and subcellular proteomics techniques, we show that RPs synthesized in axons join axonal ribosomes in a nucleolus-independent fashion. Inhibition of axonal CUIC-regulated RP translation decreases local translation activity and reduces axon branching in the developing brain, revealing the physiological relevance of axonal RP synthesis in~vivo. These results suggest that axonal translation supplies cytoplasmic RPs to maintain/modify local ribosomal function far from the nucleolus in neurons.},

Here we present an instrument to simultaneously monitor and manipulate neural activity while observing behavior in a freely moving animal, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Neural activity is recorded optically from cells expressing a calcium indicator, GCaMP3. Neural activity is manipulated optically by illuminating targeted neurons expressing the optogenetic protein Channelrhodopsin. Real-time computer vision software tracks the animal's behavior and identifies the location of targeted neurons in the nematode as it crawls. Patterned illumination from a DMD is used to selectively illuminate subsets of neurons for either calcium imaging or optogenetic stimulation. Real-time computer vision software constantly updates the illumination pattern in response to the worm's movement and thereby allows for independent optical recording or activation of different neurons in the worm as it moves freely. We use the instrument to directly observe the relationship between sensory neuron activation, interneuron dynamics and locomotion in the worm's mechanosensory circuit. We record and compare calcium transients in the backward locomotion command interneurons AVA, in response to optical activation of the anterior mechanosensory neurons ALM, AVM or both.},

(Paschal, B. M., H.  S. Shpetner, and R. B. Vallee. 1987b. J. Cell Biol. 105:1273-1282; Paschal, B.  M., and R. B. Vallee. 1987. Nature [Lond.]. 330:181-183.). Biochemical analysis  of this protein (op. cit.) as well as scanning transmission electron microscopy  revealed that MAP 1C is a brain cytoplasmic form of the ciliary and flagellar  ATPase dynein (Vallee, R. B., J. S. Wall, B. M. Paschal, and H. S. Shpetner.  1988. Nature [Lond.]. 332:561-563). We have now characterized the ATPase activity  of the brain enzyme in detail. We found that microtubule activation required  polymeric tubulin and saturated with increasing tubulin concentration. The  maximum activity at saturating tubulin (Vmax) varied from 186 to 239 nmol/min per  mg. At low ionic strength, the Km for microtubules was 0.16 mg/ml tubulin,  substantially lower than that previously reported for axonemal dynein. The  microtubule-stimulated activity was extremely sensitive to changes in ionic  strength and sulfhydryl oxidation state, both of which primarily affected the  microtubule concentrations required for half-maximal activation. In a number of  respects the brain dynein was enzymatically similar to both axonemal and egg  dyneins. Thus, the ATPase required divalent cations, calcium stimulating activity  less effectively than magnesium. The MgATPase was inhibited by metavandate (Ki =  5-10 microM for the microtubule-stimulated activity), 1 mM NEM, and 1 mM EHNA. In  contrast to other dyneins, the brain enzyme hydrolyzed CTP, TTP, and GTP at  higher rates than ATP. Thus, the enzymological properties of the brain  cytoplasmic dynein are clearly related to those of other dyneins, though the  brain enzyme is unique in its substrate specificity and in its high sensitivity  to stimulation by microtubules.},

It has been widely assumed that many cellular cargos are moved by multiple kinesins and that cargos with more motors move faster and for longer distances; concrete evidence, however, is sparse. Here we rigorously test these notions using lipid droplets in Drosophila embryos. We first employ antibody inhibition, genetics, biochemistry, and particle tracking to demonstrate that kinesin-1 mediates plus-end droplet motion. We then measure how variation in kinesin-1 expression affects the forces driving individual droplets and estimate the number of kinesins actively engaged per droplet. Unlike in~vitro, increased motor number results in neither longer travel distances nor higher velocities. Our data suggest that cargos in~vivo can simultaneously engage multiple kinesins and that transport properties are largely unaffected by variation in motor number. Apparently, higher-order regulatory mechanisms rather than motor number per se dominate cargo transport in~vivo.},

  abstract = {Our preliminary electron microscopic observations of embryonic chick spinal cord indicate that the majority of synapses in the cervical cord at the fourth and sixth days of incubation are found in the marginal layer rather than the mantle layer. These findings raise two basic questions about the type of connections in the marginal zone during the first week of development: are all these early synapses axondendritic, and are synaptic junctions present on axonal and dendritic growth cones? Since criteria for distinguishing between axonal and dendritic growth cones are scarce or nonexistent, serial section electron microscopy was employed to definitively identify the two types of terminals. Two types of dendritic growth cones are present in the marginal layer during the first week of development. The first type is distinguished by a dendritic stalk which expands into a club-shaped or bulb-like terminal. A characteristic feature of this type of dendritic ending is the presence of numerous vesicles which vary in diameter from about 1000 \AA{} to 2500 \AA. Its cytoplasm has a floccular appearance and is frequently electron lucent. In contrast, the second type of dendritic terminal is electron dense, has a consistently homogeneous appearance, and usually lacks the large vesicles of the first type. The shape of the second type is a finger-like process (filopodium) roughly of the same diameter as the main dendritic trunk. Evidence is presented that some dendritic growth cones observed in this study represent growing, motile processes rather than quiescent enlargements. Synapses on dendritic growth cones are quite numerous and, in addition, the first synapses on dendrites appear to form on growth cones. The hypothesis is put forward that synapses on dendritic growth cones. The hypothesis is put forward that synapses on dendritic growth cones are incorporated onto the dendritic trunk as the terminal continues to grow. Axonal growth cones may be distinguished from dendritic growth cones on the basis of their overall morphology and their cytoplasmic components. An axonal growth cone is, in general, a larger and more irregular structure than the dendritic terminal. This irregularity is due to the large number of processes radiating away from the terminal enlargement or varicosity. While dendritic terminals almost always have finger-like projections, processes of axonal growth cones are more often sheet-like extensions of cytoplasm (folipodia). Another important difference between axonal and dendritic growth cones is that ribosomes in axonal varicosities are infrequently encountered and rarely aggregated into polysomes as in dendritic terminals. Axonal growth cones are occasionally observed to be presynaptic to a dendrite during the first week of development.},

  abstract = {Axon guidance is a key process during nervous system development and regeneration. One of the best established paradigms to study the mechanisms underlying this process is the axon decision of whether or not to cross the midline in the Drosophila CNS. An essential regulator of that decision is the well conserved Slit-Robo signaling pathway. Slit guidance cues act through Robo receptors to repel axons from the midline. Despite good progress in our knowledge about these proteins, the intracellular mechanisms associated with Robo function remain poorly defined. In this work, we found that the scaffolding protein Canoe (Cno), the Drosophila orthologue of AF-6/Afadin, is essential for Slit-Robo signaling. Cno is expressed along longitudinal axonal pioneer tracts, and longitudinal Robo/Fasciclin2-positive axons aberrantly cross the midline in cno mutant embryos. cno mutant primary neurons show a significant reduction of Robo localized in growth cone filopodia and Cno forms a complex with Robo in vivo. Moreover, the commissureless (comm) phenotype (i.e., lack of commissures due to constitutive surface presentation of Robo in all neurons) is suppressed in comm, cno double-mutant embryos. Specific genetic interactions between cno, slit, robo, and genes encoding other components of the Robo pathway, such as Neurexin-IV, Syndecan, and Rac GTPases, further confirm that Cno functionally interacts with the Slit-Robo pathway. Our data argue that Cno is a novel regulator of the Slit-Robo signaling pathway, crucial for regulating the subcellular localization of Robo and for transducing its signaling to the actin cytoskeleton during axon guidance at the midline.},

However, in most cases it is not clear how sumoylation regulates various cellular functions. Emerging evidence suggests that sumoylation may play a general role in regulating protein-protein interactions, as shown in RanBP2/Nup358 and RanGAP1 interaction. In this study, we have defined an amino acid sequence motif that binds SUMO. This motif, V/I-X-V/I-V/I, was identified by NMR spectroscopic characterization of interactions among SUMO-1 and peptides derived from proteins that are known to bind SUMO or sumoylated proteins. This motif binds all SUMO paralogues (SUMO-1-3). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we also show that this SUMO-binding motif in RanBP2/Nup358 is responsible for the interaction between RanBP2/Nup358 and sumoylated RanGAP1. The SUMO-binding motif exists in nearly all proteins known to be involved in SUMO-dependent processes, suggesting its general role in sumoylation-dependent cellular functions.}

We examine the transport of precursors of synaptic vesicles (pre-SVs), endosomes and mitochondria in Caenorhabditis elegans touch receptor neurons, showing that stationary cargo are predominantly present at actin-rich regions along the neuronal process. Stationary vesicles at actin-rich regions increase the propensity of moving vesicles to stall at the same location, resulting in traffic jams arising from physical crowding. Such local traffic jams at actin-rich regions are likely to be a general feature of axonal transport since they also occur in Drosophila neurons. Repeated touch stimulation of C. elegans reduces the density of stationary pre-SVs, indicating that these traffic jams can act as both sources and sinks of vesicles. This suggests that vesicles trapped in actin-rich regions are functional reservoirs that may contribute to maintaining robust cargo flow in the neuron.

  abstract = {Intracellular transport is interspersed with frequent reversals in direction due to the presence of opposing kinesin and dynein motors on organelles that are carried as cargo. The cause and the mechanism of reversals are unknown, but are a key to understanding how cargos are delivered in a regulated manner to specific cellular locations. Unlike established single-motor biophysical assays, this problem requires understanding of the cooperative behavior of multiple interacting motors. Here we present measurements inside live Dictyostelium cells, in a cell extract and with purified motors to quantify such an ensemble function of motors. We show through precise motion analysis that reversals during endosome motion are caused by a tug-of-war between kinesin and dynein. Further, we use a combination of optical trap-based force measurements and Monte Carlo simulations to make the surprising discovery that endosome transport uses many (approximately four to eight) weak and detachment-prone dyneins in a tug-of-war against a single strong and tenacious kinesin. We elucidate how this clever choice of dissimilar motors and motor teams achieves net transport together with endosome fission, both of which are important in controlling the balance of endocytic sorting. To the best of our knowledge, this is a unique demonstration that dynein and kinesin function differently at the molecular level inside cells and of how this difference is used in a specific cellular process, namely endosome biogenesis. Our work may provide a platform to understand intracellular transport of a variety of organelles in terms of measurable quantities.}

We performed a comprehensive analysis of mammalian kinesin-3 motors from three different subfamilies (KIF1, KIF13, and KIF16). Using Forster resonance energy transfer microscopy in live cells, we show for the first time to our knowledge that KIF16B motors undergo cargo-mediated dimerization. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the monomer-to-dimer transition center around the neck coil (NC) segment and its ability to undergo intramolecular interactions in the monomer state versus intermolecular interactions in the dimer state. Regulation of NC dimerization is unique to the kinesin-3 family and in the case of KIF13A and KIF13B requires the release of a proline-induced kink between the NC and subsequent coiled-coil 1 segments. We show that dimerization of kinesin-3 motors results in superprocessive motion, with average run lengths of {$\sim$}10 {$\mu$}m, and that this property is intrinsic to the dimeric kinesin-3 motor domain. This finding opens up studies on the mechanistic basis of motor processivity. Such high processivity has not been observed for any other motor protein and suggests that kinesin-3 motors are evolutionarily adapted to serve as the marathon runners of the cellular world.}

Whereas all kinesins contain the highly conserved kinesin motor domain, different families have evolved unique motor features that enable different mechanical and functional outputs. A defining feature of kinesin-3 motors is the presence of a positively charged insert, the K-loop, in loop 12 of their motor domains. However, the mechanical and functional output of the K-loop with respect to processive motility of dimeric kinesin-3 motors is unknown. We find that, surprisingly, the K-loop plays no role in generating the superprocessive motion of dimeric kinesin-3 motors (KIF1, KIF13, and KIF16). Instead, we find that the K-loop provides kinesin-3 motors with a high microtubule affinity in the motor's ADP-bound state, a state that for other kinesins binds only weakly to the microtubule surface. A high microtubule affinity results in a high landing rate of processive kinesin-3 motors on the microtubule surface. We propose that the family-specific K-loop contributes to efficient kinesin-3 cargo transport by enhancing the initial interaction of dimeric motors with the microtubule track.}

Large terminals are often seated in cup-like depressions in giant cells and encircled by thorns. The junctional interface exhibits 3 kinds of specialization: (1) puncta adhaerentia, interpreted as simply adhesive; (2) `active' zones, interpreted as sites of chemical transmission, and (3) `gap' junctions, interpreted as sites of low electrical resistance between the apposed cells. The physiological implications of this complicated synaptic interface are considered and several possible functions are suggested. Primarily, it is suggested that the operation of such a synaptic interface would be more subtle and delicate than what has been found hitherto. Large terminals and these mixed synapses have not been seen in the cat. Slender terminals are long, relatively straight axons with several varicosities (boutons en passant) along their course, each with `active' zones. These endings are the least common in the nucleus. The most common are the small endings, which occur on all cell types and are the only ones to appear on the small neurons. No correlation was found between sizes of synaptic vesicles and sizes of the endings as all kinds of terminals contained similar vesicles. Axo-axonal synapses and complex glomeruli are also encountered in this nucleus.},

Most dynein activities require dynactin, but the mechanisms regulating cargo-dependent dynein-dynactin interaction are poorly understood. In this study, we focus on dynein-dynactin recruitment to cargo by the conserved motor adaptor Bicaudal D2 (BICD2). We show that dynein and dynactin depend on each other for BICD2-mediated targeting to cargo and that BICD2 N-terminus (BICD2-N) strongly promotes stable interaction between dynein and dynactin both in vitro and in vivo. Direct visualization of dynein in live cells indicates that by itself the triple BICD2-N-dynein-dynactin complex is unable to interact with either cargo or microtubules. However, tethering of BICD2-N to different membranes promotes their microtubule minus-end-directed motility. We further show that LIS1 is required for dynein-mediated transport induced by membrane tethering of BICD2-N and that LIS1 contributes to dynein accumulation at microtubule plus ends and BICD2-positive cellular structures. Our results demonstrate that dynein recruitment to cargo requires concerted action of multiple dynein cofactors.},

Here we determine that, in Caenorhabditis elegans neurons, autophagosomes form near synapses and are required for neurodevelopment. We first determine, through unbiased genetic screens and systematic genetic analyses, that autophagy is required cell autonomously for presynaptic assembly and for axon outgrowth dynamics in specific neurons. We observe autophagosome biogenesis in the axon near synapses, and this localization depends on the synaptic vesicle kinesin, KIF1A/UNC-104. KIF1A/UNC-104 coordinates localized autophagosome formation by regulating the transport of the integral membrane autophagy protein, ATG-9. Our findings indicate that autophagy is spatially regulated in neurons through the transport of ATG-9 by KIF1A/UNC-104 to regulate neurodevelopment.},

  abstract = {Evidence is presented that the kinesin-related ncd protein is not as processive as kinesin. In low surface density motility experiments, a dimeric ncd fusion protein behaved mechanistically more similar to non-processive myosins than to the highly processive kinesin. First, there was a critical microtubule length for motility; only microtubules longer than this critical length moved in low density ncd surfaces, which suggested that multiple ncd proteins must cooperate to move microtubules in the surface assay. Under similar conditions, native kinesin demonstrated no critical microtubule length, consistent with the behavior of a highly processive motor. Second, addition of methylcellulose to decrease microtubule diffusion decreased the critical microtubule length for motility. Also, the rates of microtubule motility were microtubule length dependent in methylcellulose; short microtubules, that interacted with fewer ncd proteins, moved more slowly than long microtubules that interacted with more ncd proteins. In contrast, short microtubules, that interacted with one or a few kinesin proteins, moved on average slightly faster than long microtubules that interacted with multiple kinesins. We conclude that a degree of processivity as high as that of kinesin, where a single dimer can move over distances on the order of one micrometer, may not be a general mechanistic feature of the kinesin superfamily.},

  abstract = {In vertebrate neurons, axons have a uniform arrangement of microtubules with plus ends distal to the cell body (plus-end-out), and dendrites have equal numbers of plus- and minus-end-out microtubules. To determine whether microtubule orientation is a conserved feature of axons and dendrites, we analyzed microtubule orientation in invertebrate neurons. Using microtubule plus end dynamics, we mapped microtubule orientation in Drosophila sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons. As expected, all axonal microtubules have plus-end-out orientation. However, in proximal dendrites of all classes of neuron, {$\sim$}90\% of dendritic microtubules were oriented with minus ends distal to the cell body. This result suggests that minus-end-out, rather than mixed orientation, microtubules are the signature of the dendritic microtubule cytoskeleton. Surprisingly, our map of microtubule orientation predicts that there are no tracks for direct cargo transport between the cell body and dendrites in unipolar neurons. We confirm this prediction, and validate the completeness of our map, by imaging endosome movements in motor neurons. As predicted by our map, endosomes travel smoothly between the cell body and axon, but they cannot move directly between the cell body and dendrites.}

  abstract = {Anterograde melanosome transport is essential for adaptive skin tanning response. However, the molecular components involved, their interplay and regulation by external cues in melanosome transport remain under-explored. Silencing of kinesin motors revealed that several members including the established KIF5B and a novel candidate KIF1B, mediate melanosome movement. The camouflage behaviour of zebrafish embryos induced by incident light or {$\alpha$} -MSH requires kif1b, suggesting a conserved melanosome transport machinery across vertebrates. Interestingly, the peri-nuclear melanosome accumulation upon kinesin knockdown is recapitulated by the silencing of autophagy effector MAP1LC3B (LC3B). Pull-down assays identified KIF1B, but not KIF5B, to be the LC3B-associated kinesin. LC3B binds the adapter SKIP via its LIR docking region that is proximal to Thr12 residue, a site for phosphorylation by Protein Kinase A. We demonstrate that phosphorylation of LC3B at Thr12 is stimulated by {$\alpha$}-MSH, which potentiates the anterograde melanosome transport. Thereby, our study, identifies a novel kinesin motor KIF1B for melanosome movement and establishes LC3B as the key molecular component that facilitates {$\alpha$}-MSH responsive mobilization of melanosomes. Key HighlightsKinesin screen reveals non-redundant use of KIF5B, KIF1B motors for melanosome transportkif1b is required for camouflage response in zebrafish and melanosome movement in mammalsN-terminal region of LC3B interacts with adapter SKIP and couples kinesin KIF1B{$\alpha$}-MSH activates PKA-mediated phosphorylation of LC3B to potentiate anterograde movement Significance Melanosomes are lysosome related organelles containing melanin pigment, that are synthesized in melanocytes and transferred to the recipient keratinocytes of skin. This involves long range melanosome movement within melanocytes to reach cell periphery for the transfer to follow. Physiologically, UV protection involves local secretion of melanocyte stimulating hormone ({$\alpha$}-MSH) that acts on melanocytes to promote skin tanning response. Herein, we investigate the components involved in this process and establish that the melanosome movement is dynamically controlled by {$\alpha$}-MSH through phosphorylation of LC3B. These findings establish the mechanism behind the rapid distribution of melanosomes during tanning response and provide opportunity to intervene for sun protection.},

To support rapid and repeated rounds of release, synaptic vesicles undergo a trafficking cycle. The focal point of the vesicle cycle is Ca2+-triggered exocytosis that is followed by different routes of endocytosis and recycling. Recycling then leads to the docking and priming of the vesicles for another round of exo- and endocytosis. Recent studies have led to a better definition than previously available of how Ca2+ triggers exocytosis and how vesicles recycle. In particular, insight into how Munc18-1 collaborates with SNARE proteins in fusion, how the vesicular Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin 1 triggers fast release, and how the vesicular Rab3 protein regulates release by binding to the active zone proteins RIM1{$\alpha$} and RIM2{$\alpha$} has advanced our understanding of neurotransmitter release. The present review attempts to relate these molecular data with physiological results in an emerging view of nerve terminals as macromolecular machines.},

Recent studies have revealed several new functions of ubiquitin that are independent of proteasomal degradation. These functions include the novel signaling roles of ubiquitin in DNA repair and the activation of protein kinases such as I{$\kappa$}B kinase. In both cases, a novel form of polyubiquitin chain linked through lysine-63 of ubiquitin plays an important regulatory role. Monoubiquitination also has signaling roles that are distinct from those of polyubiquitination, as illustrated from the studies of DNA repair. Thus, polyubiquitination and monoubiquitination have emerged as important signaling mechanisms that control diverse physiological and pathological processes.},

We identified two related Schizosaccharomyces pombe proteins, Rfp1 and Rfp2, each having an N-terminal SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) and a C-terminal RING-finger domain. Genetic analysis shows that Rfp1 and Rfp2 have redundant functions; together, they are essential for cell growth and genome stability. Mammalian RNF4, an active ubiquitin E3 ligase, is an orthologue of Rfp1/Rfp2. Rfp1 and Rfp2 lack E3 activity but recruit Slx8, an active RING-finger ubiquitin ligase, through a RING-RING interaction, to form a functional E3. RNF4 complements the growth and genomic stability defects of rfp1rfp2, slx8, and rfp1rfp2slx8 mutant cells. Both the Rfp-Slx8 complex and RNF4 specifically ubiquitylate artificial SUMO-containing substrates in vitro in a SUMO binding-dependent manner. SUMOylated proteins accumulate in rfp1rfp2 double-null cells, suggesting that Rfp/Slx8 proteins may promote ubiquitin-dependent degradation of SUMOylated targets. Hence, we describe a family of SIM-containing RING-finger proteins that potentially regulates eukaryotic genome stability through linking SUMO-interaction with ubiquitin conjugation.},

We discovered an unexpected abundance of free 19S particles near synapses. The free neuronal 19S particles bind and deubiquitylate lysine 63\textendash ubiquitin (Lys63-ub), a non\textendash proteasome-targeting ubiquitin linkage. Pull-down assays revealed a significant overrepresentation of synaptic molecules as Lys63-ub interactors. Inhibition of the 19S deubiquitylase activity significantly altered excitatory synaptic transmission and reduced the synaptic availability of AMPA receptors at multiple trafficking points in a proteasome-independent manner. Together, these results reveal a moonlighting function of the regulatory proteasomal subcomplex near synapses.}

  abstract = {Sensory neurons (SNs) of Aplysia are widely used to study the molecular correlates of learning. Among these is the activation of an Aplysia (ap) MAPK that phosphorylates the transcription factor apC/EBP{$\beta$}. Because crushing the axons of the SNs induces changes similar to learning, we tested the hypothesis that apMAPK is a point of convergence on the pathways for learning and injury. One event in common is long-term hyperexcitability (LTH), and LTH was induced in the SNs after intrasomatic injection of active vertebrate extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK1; as an apMAPK surrogate). Nerve crush activated an axoplasmic kinase at the site of injury that phosphorylated apC/EBP{$\beta$}. Surprisingly, this was not apMAPK, but a kinase that was recognized by antibodies to vertebrate ERKs and to doubly phosphorylated, activated ERKs. The activated kinase was transported to the cell body and nucleus and its arrival was concurrent with an injury-induced increase in apC/EBP{$\beta$} mRNA and protein. We call this retrogradely transported kinase RISK-1. RISK-1 initiated the binding of apC/EBP{$\beta$} to the ERE enhancer site in vitro and an increase in ERE-binding was detected in injured neurons containing active RISK-1. Thus, Aplysia neurons contain two MAPK homologues, one of which is a late acting retrogradely transported injury signal. \textcopyright{} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

Comparison of force-velocity curves at limiting and saturating ATP concentrations suggests that the load-dependent diminution in kinesin velocity may be due to a decrease in the net displacement per molecule of ATP hydrolyzed, not simply to a slowing of the ATP turnover rate; kinesin would therefore appear to be a loosely coupled motor.},

The expression of KIFs is developmentally regulated, and both the mRNA and proteins of KIF2 and KIF4 are expressed abundantly in the juvenile brain. To elucidate the role of individual kinesin superfamily motor proteins during regenerative outgrowth of axons, we examined the mRNA expression of KIF1A, KIF1B, KIF2, KIF3A, KIF3B, KIF4, and KIF5 in adult mouse dorsal root ganglion cells after sciatic nerve crush. Seven to fourteen days after the nerve crush, the mRNA expression pattern of neurofilament and beta-tubulin isotypes suggested that the regenerative outgrowth of axons was active. At these stages, levels of mRNA for KIF1A, KIF1B, KIF2, KIF3A, KIF3B, KIF4, and KIF5 were 50.80\% of control. The levels of mRNA for KIF4, which are detected in juvenile brain but not in the adult, were under the detection limit in both control and regenerating dorsal root ganglion cells. Because mRNA of neither KIF2 nor KIF4 increased significantly, the results suggest that the gene expression of KIFs during regeneration does not recapitulate the embryonic development and support the hypothesis that different series of events take place during the regenerative and embryonic outgrowths of axons. In contrast, mRNA for cytoplasmic dynein was slightly increased, up to 140\%. This is consistent with the hypothesis that retrograde transport plays critical roles in regeneration such as the transport of neurotrophic factors.},

Spatiotemporal regulation of axon branching is crucial for the establishment of functional connections between appropriate pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Common understanding has been that neuronal activity contributes to the proper axon branching; however, intracellular mechanisms that underlie activity-dependent axon branching remain elusive. Here, we show, using primary cultures of the dentate granule cells, that neuronal depolarization-induced rebalance of mitochondrial motility between anterograde versus retrograde transport underlies the proper formation of axonal branches. We found that the depolarization-induced branch formation was blocked by the uncoupler p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, which suggests that mitochondria-derived ATP mediates the observed phenomena. Real-time analysis of mitochondrial movement defined the molecular mechanisms by showing that the pharmacological activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) after depolarization increased anterograde transport of mitochondria into axons. Simultaneous imaging of axonal morphology and mitochondrial distribution revealed that mitochondrial localization preceded the emergence of axonal branches. Moreover, the higher probability of mitochondrial localization was correlated with the longer lifetime of axon branches. We qualitatively confirmed that neuronal ATP levels decreased immediately after depolarization and found that the phosphorylated form of AMPK was increased. Thus, this study identifies a novel role for AMPK in the transport of axonal mitochondria that underlie the neuronal activity-dependent formation of axon branches. \textcopyright{} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {Background Schizophrenia (SCZ) is one of the most disabling psychiatric disorders. It is thought to be due to a complex interplay between polygenic and various environmental risk factors, although recent reports on genomic copy number variations suggest that a fraction of the cases could result from variably penetrant de novo variants. The gene encoding the synaptic motor protein kinesin 17 (KIF17) involved in glutamatergic synapse is a candidate gene for SCZ. Methods As part of our Synapse to Disease project, we resequenced KIF17 in a cohort of individuals with sporadic SCZ (188 subjects). Additional populations included autism spectrum disorder (142 subjects), nonsyndromic mental retardation (95 subjects), and control subjects (568 subjects). Functional validation of the human mutation was done in developing zebrafish. Results Here we report the identification of a de novo nonsense truncating mutation in one patient with SCZ, in kinesin 17, a synaptic motor protein. No de novo or truncating KIF17 mutations were found in the additional samples. We further validated the pathogenic nature of this mutation by knocking down its expression in zebrafish embryos, which resulted in a developmental defect. Conclusions Together our findings suggest that disruption of KIF17, although rare, could result in a schizophrenia phenotype and emphasize the possible involvement of rare de novo mutations in this disorder.},

This disease can be treated effectively with arsenic, which induces PML modification by small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) and proteasomal degradation. Here we demonstrate that the RING-domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase, RNF4 (also known as SNURF), targets poly-SUMO-modified proteins for degradation mediated by ubiquitin. RNF4 depletion or proteasome inhibition led to accumulation of mixed, polyubiquitinated, poly-SUMO chains. PML protein accumulated in RNF4-depleted cells and was ubiquitinated by RNF4 in a SUMO-dependent fashion in vitro. In the absence of RNF4, arsenic failed to induce degradation of PML and SUMO-modified PML accumulated in the nucleus. These results demonstrate that poly-SUMO chains can act as discrete signals from mono-SUMOylation, in this case targeting a poly-SUMOylated substrate for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.},

Little is known about how competition for binding sites affects the processivity of molecular motors and, therefore, cargo transport, organelle positioning, and microtubule organization, processes that all depend on the activity of more or less processive motors. Very few studies have been performed in the past to address this question directly. Most studies reported only minor effects of crowding on the velocity of motors. However, a controversy appears to exist regarding the effect of crowding on motor processivity. Here, we use single-molecule imaging of mGFP-labeled minimal dimeric kinesin-1 constructs in vitro to study the effects of competition on kinesin's processivity. For competitors, we use kinesin rigor mutants as static roadblocks, minimal wild-type kinesins as motile obstacles, and a cell extract as a complex mixture of microtubule-associated proteins. We find that mGFP-labeled kinesin-1 detaches prematurely from microtubules when it encounters obstacles, leading to a strong reduction of its processivity, a behavior that is largely independent of the type of obstacle used here. Kinesin has a low probability to wait briefly when encountering roadblocks. Our data suggest, furthermore, that kinesin can occasionally pass obstacles on the protofilament track.},

Kif26b expression is restricted to the metanephric mesenchyme, and its transcription is regulated by a zinc finger transcriptional regulator Sall1. However, the mechanism(s) by which Kif26b protein is regulated remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate phosphorylation and subsequent polyubiquitination of Kif26b in the developing kidney. We find that Kif26b interacts with an E3 ubiquitin ligase, neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4 (Nedd4) in developing kidney. Phosphorylation of Kif26b at Thr-1859 and Ser-1962 by the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) enhances the interaction of Kif26b with Nedd4. Nedd4 polyubiquitinates Kif26b and thereby promotes degradation of Kif26b via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Furthermore, Kif26b lacks ATPase activity but does associate with microtubules. Nocodazole treatment not only disrupts the localization of Kif26b to microtubules but also promotes phosphorylation and polyubiquitination of Kif26b. These results suggest that the function of Kif26b is microtubule-based and that Kif26b degradation in the metanephric mesenchyme via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may be important for proper kidney development.},

However, it remains controversial whether axonal neurofilaments are dynamic structures in which only subunits are transported or whether filaments assemble in the proximal axon and are transported intact as polymers to the axon terminus. To investigate the form neurofilament proteins take during transport, neurons of transgenic mice lacking axonal neurofilaments were infected with a recombinant adenoviral vector encoding epitope-tagged neurofilament M. Confocal and electron microscopy revealed that the virally encoded neurofilament M was transported in unpolymerized form along axonal microtubules. Thus, neurofilament proteins are probably transported as subunits or small oligomers along microtubules, which are major routes for slow axonal transport.}

Formation of a polyubiquitin chain is not necessary, as demonstrated by the ability of mutant ubiquitins that lack lysine residues to serve as efficient internalization signals. Fusion of ubiquitin in-frame to a receptor that lacks cytoplasmic tail lysines also promotes rapid receptor internalization, indicating that ubiquitin itself and not a specific type of linkage to the receptor acts as an internalization signal. Thus, we have defined a cellular function for monoubiquitination in alpha-factor receptor endocytosis.},

Complete loss of function of the ubiquitous splicing factor SFPQ affects zebrafish motoneuron differentiation cell autonomously. In addition to its nuclear localization, the protein unexpectedly localizes to motor axons. The cytosolic version of SFPQ abolishes motor axonal defects, rescuing key transcripts, and restores motility in the paralyzed sfpq null mutants, indicating a non-nuclear processing role in motor axons. Novel variants affecting the conserved coiled-coil domain, so far exclusively found in fALS exomes, specifically affect the ability of SFPQ to localize in axons. They broadly rescue morphology and motility in the zebrafish mutant, but alter motor axon morphology, demonstrating functional requirement for axonal SFPQ. Altogether, we uncover the axonal function of the splicing factor SFPQ in motor development and highlight the importance of the coiled-coil domain in this process. Video Abstract},

Using analysis of knock-out mice and in vitro assays, we found that, in the mammalian retina, Slit1 and Slit2, known chemorepellents for RGC axons, regulate distinct aspects of intraretinal pathfinding in different regions of the retina. In ventral and, to a much lesser extent, dorsal retina, Slits help restrict RGC axons to the OFL. Additionally, within dorsal retina exclusively, Slit2 also regulates the initial polarity of outgrowth from recently differentiated RGCs located in the retinal periphery. This regional specificity occurs despite the fact that Slits are expressed throughout the retina, and both dorsal and ventral RGCs are responsive to Slits. The gross morphology and layering of the retina of the slit-deficient retinas is normal, demonstrating that these distinct guidance defects are not the result of changes in the organization of the tissue. Although displaced or disorganized, the aberrant axons within both dorsal and ventral retina exit the eye. We also have found that the lens, which because of its peripheral location within the developing eye is ideally located to influence the initial direction of RGC axon outgrowth, secretes Slit2, suggesting this is the source of Slit regulating OFL development. These data demonstrate clearly that multiple mechanisms exist in the retina for axon guidance of which Slits are an important component.},

We used fluorescence microscopy and digital imaging techniques applied to both fixed and live cultured hippocampal neurons to visualize the localization of the mRNA binding protein, zipcode binding protein 1 (ZBP1), and its dynamic movements in response to KCl-induced depolarization at high spatial and temporal resolution. With the use of immunofluorescence, image deconvolution, and three-dimensional reconstruction, ZBP1 was localized in the form of granules that were distributed in dendrites, spines, and subsynaptic sites. KCl depolarization increased the dendritic localization of ZBP1 that was not attributed to an increase in ZBP1 expression. Live cell imaging of single cells before and after perfusion of KCl revealed the rapid and directed efflux of ZBP1 granules from the cell body into dendrites in a proximo-distal gradient. High-speed imaging of enhanced green fluorescence protein-ZBP1 granules revealed rapid anterograde and retrograde movements in dendrites as well as dynamic movements in dendritic spines. A population of ZBP1 granules colocalized with {$\beta$}-actin mRNA, and their spatial association in dendrites was increased by KCl depolarization. The NMDA receptor antagonist AP-5 impaired the dendritic localization of ZBP1 and {$\beta$}-actin mRNA and inhibited the KCl-induced transport of ZBP1. The activity-dependent trafficking of ZBP1 and its dynamic movements within dendritic spines provide new evidence to implicate RNA binding proteins as regulators of mRNA transport to activated synapses in response to synaptic activity.},

  abstract = {Cytoplasmic dynein 1 (dynein) is the primary minus end-directed motor protein in most eukaryotic cells. Dynein remains in an inactive conformation until the formation of a tripartite complex comprising dynein, its regulator dynactin and a cargo adaptor. How this process of dynein activation occurs is unclear, since it entails the formation of a three-protein complex inside the crowded environs of a cell. Here, we employed live-cell, single-molecule imaging to visualise and track fluorescently tagged dynein. First, we observed that only \textasciitilde 30\% of dynein molecules that bound to the microtubule (MT) engaged in minus end-directed movement, and that too for a short duration of \textasciitilde 0.6 s. Next, using high-resolution imaging in live and fixed cells, and using correlative light and electron microscopy, we discovered that dynactin and endosomal cargo remained in proximity to each other and to MTs. We then employed two-colour imaging to visualise cargo movement effected by single motor binding. Finally, we performed long-term imaging to show short movements are sufficient to drive cargo to the perinuclear region of the cell. We then used these discoveries as the basis for a stochastic model incorporating dynamic motors binding to cargo located along MTs, and also developed a coarse-grained 3-state run- and-tumble particle (RTP) model for the cargo that quantitatively recapitulates the emergent statistics of cargo movement. Taken together, we discovered a search mechanism that is facilitated by dynein's frequent MT binding-unbinding kinetics: (1) in a futile event when dynein does not encounter cargo anchored in proximity to the MT, dynein dissociates and diffuses into the cytoplasm, (2) when dynein encounters cargo and dynactin upon MT-binding, it moves cargo in a short run. Several of these short runs are undertaken in succession for long-range directed movement. In conclusion, we demonstrate that dynein activation and cargo capture are coupled in a step that relies on the reduction of dimensionality to enable minus end-directed transport in cellulo, and that complex cargo behaviour emerges from stochastic motor-cargo interactions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.}

  abstract = {How cargoes move within a crowded cell\textemdash over long distances and at speeds nearly the same as when moving on unimpeded pathway\textemdash has long been mysterious. Through an in vitro force-gliding assay, which involves measuring nanometer displacement and piconewtons of force, we show that multiple mammalian kinesin-1 (from 2 to 8) communicate in a team by inducing tension (up to 4 pN) on the cargo. Kinesins adopt two distinct states, with one-third slowing down the microtubule and two-thirds speeding it up. Resisting kinesins tend to come off more rapidly than, and speed up when pulled by driving kinesins, implying an asymmetric tug-of-war. Furthermore, kinesins dynamically interact to overcome roadblocks, occasionally combining their forces. Consequently, multiple kinesins acting as a team may play a significant role in facilitating smooth cargo motion in a dense environment. This is one of few cases in which single molecule behavior can be connected to ensemble behavior of multiple motors.},

We have molecularly cloned cDNAs for a gene that codes for a novel member of the kinesin family of proteins. Nucleotide sequencing reveals that the predicted gene product is a 73 kDa protein and is related to some extent to the Drosophila node gene product, which is involved in chromosomal segregation during meiosis. A sequence similar to the microtubule binding motor domain of kinesin is present in the N-terminal half of the protein, and its ability to bind to microtubules is demonstrated. Furthermore we show that its C-terminal half contains a putative nuclear localization signal similar to that of Jun and is able to bind to DNA. Accordingly, the protein was termed Kid (kinesin-like DNA binding protein). Indirect immunofluorescence studies show that Kid colocalizes with mitotic chromosomes and that it is enriched in the kinetochore at anaphase. Thus, we propose that Kid might play a role(s) in regulating the chromosomal movement along microtubules during mitosis.}

However, local synthesis is difficult to evaluate because of rapid somatodendritic protein transport. The present study describes a two-surfaced culture system that allowed the separation of living axons and dendrites from their cell bodies of origin. Because this system eliminates the transport of proteins produced in the cell body, it was possible to study the extent of dendritic protein synthesis directly. Hippocampal neurons were plated on a Nucleopore polycarbonate membrane that was mounted on a thick matrix of proteins (Matrigel) fixed on a coverslip. As the neurons grew, axons and dendrites grew through the membrane into the Matrigel. To evaluate local protein synthesis within dendrites, the membrane with the cell bodies was removed, leaving a dense array of transected dendrites and axons on the coverslip with few contaminant cell bodies. Absence of cell bodies was confirmed by staining with the nuclear stain Hoechst 33258. Coverslips with isolated neurites were pulse labeled with 3H-leucine for 30 min, and fixed for autoradiography to identify sites of protein synthesis. Autoradiographic analyses revealed that isolated dendrites (immunochemically identified using antibodies against MAP2) became heavily labeled, whereas axons exhibited little if any labeling. The labeling was essentially eliminated when the neurites were pulse labeled with 3H-leucine in the presence of puromycin, whereas labeling was affected only minimally by chloramphenicol. The puromycin-sensitive incorporation of 3H-leucine in dendrites demonstrates that the polyribosomes previously described are active in protein synthesis. This system will allow a characterization of synthetic activity within isolated neurites and provide a new approach to identifying proteins that are produced within dendrites.},

This localization is critical as dynein powers essential retrograde trafficking events required for neuronal survival, such as neurotrophic signaling. Here, we demonstrate that the outward transport of dynein from soma to axon terminal is driven by direct interactions with the anterograde motor kinesin-1. In developing neurons, we find that dynein dynamically cycles between neurites, following kinesin-1 and accumulating in the nascent axon coincident with axon specification. In established axons, dynein is constantly transported down the axon at slow axonal transport speeds; inhibition of the kinesin-1-dynein interaction effectively blocks this process. In~vitro and live-imaging assays to investigate the underlying mechanism lead us to propose a new model for the slow axonal transport of cytosolic cargos, based on short-lived direct interactions of cargo with a highly processive anterograde motor.

Structure-function analysis in rat embryonic sensory neurons shows that the kinesin-1 interacting domain in MAP7 is required for axon and branch growth but not for branch formation. Also, two unique microtubule binding sites are found in MAP7 that have distinct dissociation kinetics and are both required for branch formation. Furthermore, MAP7 recruits kinesin-1 dynamically to microtubules, leading to alterations in organelle transport behaviors, particularly pause/speed switching. As MAP7 is localized to branch sites, our results suggest a novel mechanism mediated by the dual interactions of MAP7 with microtubules and kinesin-1 in the precise control of microtubule-based transport during axon morphogenesis.},

Using an optogenetic tool, we demonstrate that signaling from the growth cone can rapidly direct transport through branch junctions. We further demonstrate that such transport selectivity is differentially regulated for different vesicles and mediated by the KIF1/kinesin-3 family motors. We propose that this transport regulation through branch junctions could broadly impact neuronal development, function, and regeneration.},

A similar accumulation of such conjugates was detected in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ubc4 ubc5 cells as well as in mutants lacking two RING finger proteins, Ris1 and Hex3/Slx5-Slx8, that bind to SUMO as well as to the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Ubc4. In vitro, Hex3-Slx8 complexes promote Ubc4-dependent ubiquitylation. Together these data identify a previously unrecognized pathway that mediates the proteolytic down-regulation of sumoylated proteins. Formation of substrate-linked SUMO chains promotes targeting of SUMO-modified substrates for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that SUMO conjugation can ultimately lead to inactivation of sumoylated substrates by polysumoylation and/or ubiquitin-dependent degradation.

Retrograde bead movement (1.4 micron/sec) is inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide and 20 microM vanadate while anterograde movement (0.6 micron/sec) is unaffected by these agents.

TRIM46 is specifically localized to the newly specified axon and, at later stages, partly overlaps with the axon initial segment (AIS). TRIM46 specifically forms closely spaced parallel microtubule bundles oriented with their plus-end out. Without TRIM46, all neurites have a dendrite-like mixed microtubule organization resulting in Tau missorting and altered cargo trafficking. By forming uniform microtubule bundles in the axon, TRIM46 is required for neuronal polarity and axon specification in~vitro and in~vivo. Thus, TRIM46 defines a unique axonal cytoskeletal compartment for regulating microtubule organization during neuronal development.},

Eps15 ubiquitination but not tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited under conditions that blocked EGF-induced internalization of the EGF receptor.

  abstract = {Asymmetric transport of cargo across axonal branches is a field of active research. Mechanisms contributing to preferential cargo transport along specific branches in vivo in wild type neurons are poorly understood. We find that anterograde synaptic vesicles preferentially enter the synaptic branch or pause at the branch point in C. elegans PLM neurons. The anterograde motor UNC-104/KIF1A regulates this vesicle behaviour at the branch point. Reduced levels of functional UNC-104 cause vesicles to predominantly pause at the branch point and lose their preference for turning into the synaptic branch. SAM-4/Myrlysin, which aids in recruitment/activation of UNC-104 on synaptic vesicles, regulates vesicle behaviour at the branch point similar to UNC-104. Increasing the levels of UNC-104 increases the preference of vesicles to go straight towards the asynaptic end. This suggests that the neuron optimises UNC-104 levels on the cargo surface to maximise the fraction of vesicles entering the branch and minimise the fraction going to the asynaptic end.},

  abstract = {Motor-based intracellular transport and its regulation are crucial to the functioning of a cell. Disruption of transport is linked to Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, many fundamental aspects of transport are poorly understood. An important issue is how cells achieve and regulate efficient long-distance transport. Mounting evidence suggests that many in vivo cargoes are transported along microtubules by more than one motor, but we do not know how multiple motors work together or can be regulated. Here we first show that multiple kinesin motors, working in conjunction, can achieve very long distance transport and apply significantly larger forces without the need of additional factors. We then demonstrate in vitro that the important microtubule-associated protein, tau, regulates the number of engaged kinesin motors per cargo via its local concentration on microtubules. This function of tau provides a previously unappreciated mechanism to regulate transport. By reducing motor reattachment rates, tau affects cargo travel distance, motive force, and cargo dispersal. We also show that different isoforms of tau, at concentrations similar to those in cells, have dramatically different potency. These results provide a well defined mechanism for how altered tau isoform levels could impair transport and thereby lead to neurodegeneration without the need of any other pathway.},

Using sNUSP, we identified 607 neddylation sites dynamically regulated by the neddylation inhibitor MLN4924 and the de-neddylating enzyme NEDP1, implying that many non-cullin proteins are neddylated. Among the candidates, we characterized lysine 112 of the actin regulator cofilin as a novel neddylation event. Global inhibition of neddylation in developing neurons leads to cytoskeletal defects, altered actin dynamics and neurite growth impairments, whereas site-specific neddylation of cofilin at K112 regulates neurite outgrowth, suggesting that cofilin neddylation contributes to the regulation of neuronal actin organization.},

Although the mechanism of cargo binding is well understood, little is known how motor activity is regulated. We mapped functional interaction domains between SYD-2 and UNC-104 by using yeast 2-hybrid and pull-down assays and by using FRET/fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy to image the binding of SYD-2 to UNC-104 in living Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that UNC-104 forms SYD-2-dependent axonal clusters (appearing during the transition from L2 to L3 larval stages), which behave in FRAP experiments as dynamic aggregates. High-resolution microscopy reveals that these clusters contain UNC-104 and synaptic precursors (synaptobrevin-1). Analysis of motor motility indicates bi-directional movement of UNC-104, whereas in syd-2 mutants, loss of SYD-2 binding reduces net anterograde movement and velocity (similar after deleting UNC-104's liprin-binding domain), switching to retrograde transport characteristics when no role of SYD-2 on dynein and conventional kinesin UNC-116 motility was found. These data present a kinesin scaffolding protein that controls both motor clustering along axons and motor motility, resulting in reduced cargo transport efficiency upon loss of interaction.},

Ubiquitination usually involves the addition of ubiquitin chains to target protein molecules, and these may be of eight different types, seven of which involve the linkage of one of the seven internal lysine (K) residues in one ubiquitin molecule to the carboxy-terminal diglycine of the next. In the eighth, the so-called linear ubiquitin chains, the linkage is between the amino-terminal amino group of methionine on a ubiquitin that is conjugated with a target protein and the carboxy-terminal carboxy group of the incoming ubiquitin. Physiological roles are well established for K48-linked chains, which are essential for signaling proteasomal degradation of proteins, and for K63-linked chains, which play a part in recruitment of DNA repair enzymes, cell signaling and endocytosis. We focus here on linear ubiquitin chains, how they are assembled, and how three different avenues of research have indicated physiological roles for linear ubiquitination in innate and adaptive immunity and suppression of inflammation.},

In dilute solution, the globular protein chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI2, 7.4 kDa) diffuses faster than the disordered protein {$\alpha$}-synuclein (14 kDa). Surprisingly, the opposite occurs under crowded conditions; {$\alpha$}-synuclein diffuses faster than CI2, even though {$\alpha$}-synuclein is larger than CI2. These data show that shape is a key parameter determining protein diffusion under crowded conditions, adding to the properties known to be affected by macromolecular crowding.

Here, we show that microglial EED is essential for synaptic pruning during the postnatal stage of brain development. The absence of microglial EED at early postnatal stages resulted in reduced spines and impaired synapse density in the hippocampus at adulthood, accompanied by upregulated expression of phagocytosis-related genes in microglia. As a result, deletion of microglial Eed impaired hippocampus-dependent learning and memory in mice. These results suggest that microglial EED is critical for normal synaptic and cognitive functions during postnatal development.},

Cytoplasmic dynein is necessary but not sufficient for retrograde transport directed from the synapse to the cell body. Dynactin is a heteromultimeric protein complex, enriched in neurons, that binds to both microtubules and cytoplasmic dynein. To determine whether dynactin is required for retrograde axonal transport, we examined the effects of anti-dynactin antibodies on organelle transport in extruded axoplasm. Treatment of axoplasm with antibodies to the p150Glued subunit of dynactin resulted in a significant decrease in the velocity of microtubule-based organelle transport, with many organelles bound along microtubules. We examined the molecular mechanism of the observed inhibition of motility, and we demonstrated that antibodies to p150Glued disrupted the binding of cytoplasmic dynein to dynactin and also inhibited the association of cytoplasmic dynein with organelles. In contrast, the anti-p150Glued antibodies had no effect on the binding of dynactin to microtubules nor on cytoplasmic dynein-driven microtubule gliding. These results indicate that the interaction between cytoplasmic dynein and the dynactin complex is required for the axonal transport of membrane-bound vesicles and support the hypothesis that dynactin may function as a link between the organelle, the microtubule, and cytoplasmic dynein during vesicle transport.},

Highly phosphorylated neurofilament epitopes did not redistribute along the nerve, but there was a gradual loss of phosphorylated neurofilament immunoreactivity. These observations indicate the potential for bidirectional transport of a substantial portion of certain cytoskeletal proteins within axons of the PNS.},

  abstract = {Fragile X mental retardation syndrome results from the absence of or a defect in the protein (FMRP) encoded by the FMR1 gene. FMRP is found in dendrites and synapses as well as in the neuronal cell soma and nucleus, and although it is known to bind to RNA, the function of the protein in neurons is not known. We have studied activity-dependent changes in postsynaptically localized protein translation in central nervous system neurons. We find that FMRP is one of the proteins produced at synapses following stimulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. We have also observed that Fragile X knockout mice, like human Fragile X patients, have excess numbers of long, thin, immature-appearing dendritic processes. Together, these findings suggest that FMRP plays a role in the process whereby synaptic activity during development results in structural and functional maturation of the synapse. We hypothesize that synaptic synthesis of FMRP may be essential for activity-based synapse maturation and elimination, a key process in normal brain development. Am. J. Med.

  abstract = {The ATPase activity of sea urchin eggs and isolated mitotic apparatus has been investigated. The egg contains ATPase activity which is readily solubilized by homogenization in an isotonic sucrose-MgCl2 solution. Most of this activity migrates with a sedimentation coefficient of about 13 {$\pm$} 1 S in sucrose gradient centrifugation. The soluble ATPase is activated by both Mg and Ca, has a pH dependence with optima at about pH 7.5 and 9.5 and hydrolyses ATP at a faster rate than GTP or ITP. These properties are similar to those of the ciliary ATPase dynein, and the soluble enzyme may be a cilia precursor. A readily soluble 13 S ATPase is also present in the isolated mitotic apparatus in small amounts. The addition of MgCl2 to the isolation medium did not affect the level of soluble activity obtained, although it did increase the level of particulate activity. The specific activity of the soluble enzyme of mitotic apparatus is about equal to that obtainable from the cytoplasm when treated, as nearly as possible, in the same way. It is not possible, therefore, to positively identify the ATPase as a specific mitotic apparatus component. The amount of ATPase activity present is nevertheless adequate to account for the energy output of the spindle.},

How cells regulate such transport in time and space is a fundamental but unsolved question in cell biology. A recent paper presents a new modeling approach to predict how much of transport can be understood just from our knowledge of the motors involved. The model can generate strikingly complex patterns of motion, mimicking key aspects of cargo transport in vivo. Previous studies had inferred that plus-end motors on bidirectional cargoes are usually turned off when the minus-end motors are engaged ``and vice versa\ldots. In the model, such motor coordination can arise from motors competing in a tug-of-war, without help from additional regulators. This new theoretical framework should stimulate much research that will help unravel whether regulation of intracellular transport is dominated by higher-order control mechanisms or is achieved simply by tuning basic properties of the motors themselves.},

The following evidence supports the view that APF-1 is ubiquitin, a highly conserved heat-stable polypeptide found universally in nature: 1) APF-1 and ubiquitin (generously given by G. Goldstein) yield co-migrating bands on five polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis systems and in isoelectric focusing; 2) amino acid analysis shows excellent agreement between the two proteins; 3) APF-1 and ubiquitin give similar specific activity, in activating the ATP-dependent proteolysis system; 4) 125I-APF-1 and 125I-ubiquitin form electrophoretically identical covalent conjugates with endogenous reticulocyte proteins. Recently, such conjugates have been proposed as the active intermediates in ATP-dependent proteolysis (Ciechanover, A., Heller, H., Hershko, A., Haas, A.L., and Rose, I.A. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad.

K., and Haas, A. L. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 7529-7532). We have extended this work to show that the peptic peptide maps are identical for bovine ubiquitin and the polypeptide cofactor isolated from human erythrocytes. It was noted however that ubiquitin preparations were less active in stimulating proteolysis than preparations of the polypeptide cofactor. This decreased activity has been shown to be due to the presence of an inactive form of ubiquitin in some preparations. The two forms of ubiquitin are separable by high performance liquid chromatography. The active form of ubiquitin has the COOH-terminal sequence -Arg-Gly-Gly at residues number 74 to 76. The inactive form terminates in -Arg74 as previously reported in the sequence studies of ubiquitin. Limited tryptic digestion of active ubiquitin yields the inactive, later eluting form and the dipeptide glycylglycine. This preteolytic cleavage apparently occurs during purification from most tissues. We thus propose reserving the term ubiquitin for the intact 76-amino acid sequence and designating the 74-amino acid sequence as ubiquitin-t to indicate its derivation by a tryptic-like protease cleavage. This 76-residue sequence is consistent with the covalent structure of protein A-24, a conjugate where carboxyl group of the COOH-terminal glycylglycine of ubiquitin is linked by an amide bond to the epsilon-amino group of Lys-119 of histone H2A. Thus, the structural requirements of the protein and ubiquitin molecules are identical for formation of protein A-24 and for forming the covalent conjugates thought to be intermediates in ATP-dependent protein degradation.},

  abstract = {Regulation of cellular volume is a critical homeostatic process that is intimately linked to ionic and osmotic balance in the brain tissue. Because the brain is encased in the rigid skull and has a very complex cellular architecture, even minute changes in the volume of extracellular and intracellular compartments have a very strong impact on tissue excitability and function. The failure of cell volume control is a major feature of several neuropathologies, such as hyponatremia, stroke, epilepsy, hyperammonemia, and others. There is strong evidence that such dysregulation, especially uncontrolled cell swelling, plays a major role in adverse pathological outcomes. To protect themselves, brain cells utilize a variety of mechanisms to maintain their optimal volume, primarily by releasing or taking in ions and small organic molecules through diverse volume-sensitive ion channels and transporters. In principle, the mechanisms of cell volume regulation are not unique to the brain and share many commonalities with other tissues. However, because ions and some organic osmolytes (e.g., major amino acid neurotransmitters) have a strong impact on neuronal excitability, cell volume regulation in the brain is a surprisingly treacherous process, which may cause more harm than good. This topical review covers the established and emerging information in this rapidly developing area of physiology.},

Predictive understanding of motility in cells therefore requires quantitative insights into mixed ensembles of cargos. Toward this goal, here we employed Monte Carlo simulations to investigate statistical ensembles of cargos carried by a Poisson-distributed number of motors. Focusing on the key microtubule-based motor kinesin-1, our simulations utilized experimentally determined single-kinesin characteristics and alterations in kinesin's on- and off-rates caused by cellular factors and/or physical load. We found that a fractional increase in mean kinesin number enhances the ensemble-averaged cargo run length and amplifies run-length sensitivity to changes in single-kinesin on-rate and off-rate. These tuning effects can be further enhanced as solution viscosity increases over the range reported for cells. Together, our data indicate that the physiological range of kinesin number sensitively tunes the motility of mixed cargo populations. These effects have rich implications for quantitative and predictive understanding of cellular motility and its regulation.},

Different polyubiquitin chains have different functions. Lys48-linked chains target proteins for proteasomal degradation, and Lys63-linked chains function in signal transduction, endocytosis and DNA repair. For this reason, chain topology must be tightly controlled. Using the U-box E3 ligase CHIP [C-terminus of the Hsc (heat-shock cognate) 70-interacting protein] and the RING E3 ligase TRAF6 (tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-associated factor 6) with the E2s Ubc13 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 13)\textendash Uev1a (ubiquitin E2 variant 1a) and UbcH5a, in the present study we demonstrate that Ubc13\textendash Uev1a supports the formation of free Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains not attached to CHIP or TRAF6, whereas UbcH5a catalyses the formation of polyubiquitin chains linked to CHIP and TRAF6 that lack specificity for any lysine residue of ubiquitin. Therefore the abilities of these E2s to ubiquitinate a substrate and to elongate polyubiquitin chains of a specific topology appear to be mutually exclusive. Thus two different classes of E2 may be required to attach a polyubiquitin chain of a particular topology to a substrate: the properties of one E2 are designed to mono-ubiquitinate a substrate with no or little inherent specificity for an acceptor lysine residue, whereas the properties of the second E2 are tailored to the elongation of a polyubiquitin chain using a defined lysine residue of ubiquitin.}

Loss of polarity or formation of multiple axons after manipulation of neuronal polarity regulators, synapses of amphids defective (SAD) kinases, and glycogen synthase kinase-3{$\beta$} correlates with characteristic changes in microtubule turnover. Consistently, changing the microtubule dynamics is sufficient to alter neuronal polarization. Application of low doses of the microtubule-destabilizing drug nocodazole selectively reduces the formation of future dendrites. Conversely, low doses of the microtubule-stabilizing drug taxol shift polymerizing microtubules from neurite shafts to process tips and lead to the formation of multiple axons. Finally, local stabilization of microtubules using a photoactivatable analogue of taxol induces axon formation from the activated area. Thus, local microtubule stabilization in one neurite is a physiological signal specifying neuronal polarization.}

In the last three decades, mounting evidence has established that neuronal development relies on the coordinated regulation of gene expression, cytoskeletal dynamics, and membrane trafficking. Membrane trafficking has been considered important in that it brings new membrane and proteins to the plasma membrane of developing neurons and because it also generates and maintains the polarized distribution of proteins into neuronal subdomains. More recently, accumulating evidence suggests that membrane trafficking may have an even more active role during development by regulating the distribution and degree of activation of a wide variety of proteins located in plasma membrane subdomains and endosomes.

This dynamic regulation manifests itself in axonal branching, turning and pathfinding, presynaptic differentiation, and growth cone collapse and extension. Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), a secreted guidance cue that primarily functions to repel axons from inappropriate targets, induces cytoskeletal rearrangements that result in growth cone collapse1. These effects require intra-axonal messenger RNA translation. Here we show that transcripts for RhoA, a small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) that regulates the actin cytoskeleton, are localized to developing axons and growth cones, and this localization is mediated by an axonal targeting element located in the RhoA 3{${'}$} untranslated region (UTR). Sema3A induces intra-axonal translation of RhoA mRNA, and this local translation of RhoA is necessary and sufficient for Sema3A-mediated growth cone collapse. These studies indicate that local RhoA translation regulates the neuronal cytoskeleton and identify a new mechanism for the regulation of RhoA signalling.},

The amino acid sequence of mouse PAT1 is similar to that of the kinesin light chain (KLC), and we found that PAT1 binds to KLC directly. Studying PAT1 in mouse primary hippocampal neuronal cultures from both sexes and using structured illumination microscopic imaging of these neurons, we observed that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) enhances co-localization of dendritic ZBP1 and PAT1 within granules that also contain kinesin-I. PAT1 is essential for BDNF-stimulated neuronal growth cone development and dendritic protrusion formation, and we noted that ZBP1 and PAT1 co-locate along with {$\beta$}-actin mRNA in actively transported granules in living neurons. Acute disruption of the PAT1\textendash ZBP1 interaction in neurons with PAT1 siRNA or a dominant-negative ZBP1 construct diminished localization of {$\beta$}-actin mRNA but not of Ca\textsuperscript{2+}/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II{$\alpha$} (\emph{CaMKII}{$\alpha$}) mRNA in dendrites. The aberrant {$\beta$}-actin mRNA localization resulted in abnormal dendritic protrusions and growth cone dynamics. These results suggest a critical role for PAT1 in BDNF-induced {$\beta$}-actin mRNA transport during postnatal development and reveal a new molecular mechanism for mRNA localization in vertebrates.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {We investigated the relationship between slow axonal transport and axonal regeneration in the rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cell. The DRG cell sends out a single axon which bifurcates within the ganglion; one axon proceeds centrally into the spinal cord and the other proceeds peripherally. The rate of axonal regeneration is approximately 2 times faster for the peripheral processes (4.6 +/- 0.9 mm/day) than for the central processes (2.1 +/- 0.5 mm/day). The peripheral and central processes regenerate through dissimilar environments (sciatic nerve and dorsal root, respectively); thus, environmental factors may account for the differences in regeneration rates. We tested this possibility by measuring the regeneration of motoneuron axons within the ventral root (histologically similar to the dorsal root). The motoneuron regeneration rate within the ventral root is similar to the motoneuron regeneration rate within the sciatic nerve, suggesting that factors within the DRG cell produce the differences in regeneration rate. Slow axonal transport is classified into two distinct components: slow component a (SCa), corresponding to the microtubule/neurofilament network of the axonal cytoskeleton, and slow component b (SCb), corresponding to the microfilament complex/axoplasmic matrix. The transport rate of SCa and SCb in the peripheral sensory axons is approximately 2 times faster than their counterparts in the central sensory axons. SCa moves at 1.0 to 3.0 mm/day in the peripheral processes and 0.5 to 1.0 mm/day in the central processes; SCb moves at 3.5 to 6.5 mm/day in the peripheral processes and 2.0 to 3.5 mm/day in the central processes. In each branch of the DRG cell, the rate of axonal regeneration is similar to the rate of SCb transport. These results support the hypothesis that SCb is a rate-limiting factor in axonal regeneration because of its role in providing the cytoskeletal elements which are directly involved in the motility of the growth cone and elongation of the axon.},

Both proteins have RING domains at their C termini. Such domains are common in ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like protein ligases (E3s), but little was known about the molecular functions of either protein. In this study we identified HEX3 as a high-copy suppressor of a temperature-sensitive small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) protease mutant, ulp1ts, suggesting that it may affect cellular SUMO dynamics. Remarkably, even a complete deletion of ULP1 is strongly suppressed. Hex3 forms a heterodimer with Slx8. We found that the Hex3.Slx8 complex has a robust substrate-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. In this E3 complex, Slx8 appears to bear the core ligase function, with Hex3 strongly enhancing its activity. Notably, SUMO attachment to a substrate stimulates its Hex3.Slx8-dependent ubiquitination, primarily through direct noncovalent interactions between SUMO and Hex3. Our data reveal a novel mechanism of substrate targeting in which sumoylation of a protein can help trigger its subsequent ubiquitination by recruiting a SUMO-binding ubiquitin ligase.},

However, it remains unknown whether and why motor proteins generate sidesteps movement along their filamentous tracks in~vivo. Using Hessian structured illumination microscopy, we located green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled intraflagellar transport (IFT) particles inside sensory cilia of live Caenorhabditis elegans with 3?6-nanometer accuracy and 3.4-ms resolution. We found that IFT particles took sidesteps along axoneme microtubules, demonstrating that IFT motors generate torque in a living animal. Kinesin-II and OSM-3-kinesin collaboratively drive anterograde IFT. We showed that the deletion of kinesin-II, a torque-generating motor protein, reduced sidesteps, whereas the increase of neck flexibility of OSM-3-kinesin upregulated sidesteps. Either increase or decrease of sidesteps of IFT kinesins allowed ciliogenesis to the regular length, but changed IFT speeds, disrupted axonemal ninefold symmetry, and inhibited sensory cilia-dependent animal behaviors. Thus, an optimum level of IFT kinesin sidestepping is associated with the structural and functional fidelity of cilia.},

Here, we show that the Golgi protein golgin160 recruits dynein to Golgi membranes. This recruitment confers centripetal motility to membranes and is regulated by the GTPase Arf1. Further, during cell division, motor association with membranes is regulated by the dissociation of the receptor-motor complex from membranes. These results identify a cell-cycle-regulated membrane receptor for a molecular motor and~suggest a mechanistic basis for achieving the dramatic changes in organelle positioning seen during cell division.},

Canonical signaling by morphogens regulates transcription in the nucleus to specify cell fate. Recent studies have begun to elucidate how these morphogens can also direct growth cone turning, using signaling mechanisms that diverge from their canonical signaling pathways.

However, it is unclear how swinging of the neck helix is driven by ATP hydrolysis utilizing the highly conserved catalytic core among all kinesins. Here, using a motility assay, we show that in addition to the neck helix, the conserved five residues at the C-terminal region in kinesin-14, namely the neck mimic, are necessary to give kinesin-1 an ability to reverse its directionality toward the minus end of microtubules. Our structural analyses further demonstrate that the C-terminal neck mimic, in cooperation with conformational changes in the catalytic core during ATP binding, forms a kinesin-14 bundle with the N-terminal neck helix to swing toward the minus end of microtubules. Thus, the neck mimic plays a crucial role in coupling the chemical ATPase reaction with the mechanical cycle to produce the minus-end-directed motility of kinesin-14.},

Understanding the mechanism by which DLK kinases are activated is thus of central importance. Here, we show that C. elegans DLK-1 is activated by a novel Ca2+-dependent switch from inactive heteromeric to active homomeric protein complexes. A newly identified DLK-1 isoform, DLK-1S, shares identical kinase and leucine zipper domains with the previously described long isoform DLK-1L, but acts to inhibit DLK-1 function by binding to DLK-1L. The switch between homo- or hetero-meric DLK-1 complexes is influenced by Ca2+ concentration. A conserved hexapeptide in the DLK-1L C-terminus is essential for DLK-1 activity and is required for Ca2+ regulation. The mammalian DLK-1 homolog MAP3K13, also known as Leucine-Zipper-Kinase (LZK) contains an identical C-terminal hexapeptide and can functionally complement dlk-1 mutants, suggesting that the DLK activation mechanism is conserved. The DLK activation mechanism is ideally suited for rapid and spatially controlled signal transduction in response to axonal injury and synaptic activity.},

The results demonstrate that (i) kinesin heavy chain alone, without the light chains and other eukaryotic factors, is able to induce microtubule movement in vitro, and (ii) a fragment likely to contain only the kinesin head is also capable of inducing microtubule motility. Thus, the amino-terminal 450 amino acids of kinesin contain all the basic elements needed to convert chemical energy into mechanical force.}

We discovered a spatial heterogeneity of endolysosomal compartments in dendrites. Early EEA1-positive and late Rab7-positive endosomes are found throughout dendrites, whereas the density of degradative LAMP1- and cathepsin (Cat) B/D\textendash positive lysosomes decreases steeply past the proximal segment. Unlike in fibroblasts, we found that the majority of dendritic Rab7 late endosomes (LEs) do not contain LAMP1 and that a large proportion of LAMP1 compartments do not contain CatB/D. Second, Rab7 activity is required to mobilize distal predegradative LEs for transport to the soma and terminal degradation. We conclude that the majority of dendritic LAMP1 endosomes are not degradative lysosomes and that terminal degradation of dendritic cargos such as Nsg1, Nsg2, and DNER requires Rab7-dependent transport in LEs to somatic lysosomes.}

We have labeled a single head of the kinesin dimer with a Cy3 fluorophore and localized the position of the dye to within 2 nm before and after a step. We observed that single kinesin heads take steps of 17.3 {$\pm$} 3.3 nm. A kinetic analysis of the dwell times between steps shows that the 17-nm steps alternate with 0-nm steps. These results strongly support a hand-over-hand mechanism, and not an inchworm mechanism.

KIF1A mutants died mostly within a day after birth showing motor and sensory disturbances. In the nervous systems of these mutants, the transport of synaptic vesicle precursors showed a specific and significant decrease. Consequently, synaptic vesicle density decreased dramatically, and clusters of clear small vesicles accumulated in the cell bodies. Furthermore, marked neuronal degeneration and death occurred both in KIF1A mutant mice and in cultures of mutant neurons. The neuronal death in cultures was blocked by coculture with wild-type neurons or exposure to a low concentration of glutamate. These results in cultures suggested that the mutant neurons might not sufficiently receive afferent stimulation, such as neuronal contacts or neurotransmission, resulting in cell death. Thus, our results demonstrate that KIF1A transports a synaptic vesicle precursor and that KIF1A-mediated axonal transport plays a critical role in viability, maintenance, and function of neurons, particularly mature neurons.}

Accumulating evidence indicated the importance of the evolutionarily conserved kinase Par1b in the regulation of cell polarity. Using hippocampal neurons in culture, it has been shown that Par1b regulates axon specification, but the underlying mechanism remains uncharacterized. We identify GAKIN/KIF13B as a novel Par1b-binding protein and reveal that GAKIN/KIF13B is a physiological substrate for Par1b, and the phosphorylation sites are conserved from Drosophila. In hippocampal neurons, GAKIN/KIF13B accumulates at the distal part of the microtubules in the tips of axons, but not of dendrites. Overexpression of GAKIN/KIF13B by itself can induce the formation of extra axons, which is inhibited by the coexpression of Par1b in a manner dependent on its kinase activity. In contrast, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of GAKIN/KIF13B severely retards neurite extension and promotes the axonless phenotype. The extra axon phenotype caused by Par1b siRNA is suppressed by cointroduction of GAKIN/KIF13B siRNA, thus placing the GAKIN/KIF13B function downstream of Par1b. We also find that GAKIN/KIF13B acts downstream of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling via Par1b phosphorylation. These results reveal that GAKIN/KIF13B is a key intermediate linking Par1b to the regulation of axon formation.},

RAUL limited type I IFN production by directly catalyzing lysine 48-linked polyubiquitination of both interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and IRF3 followed by proteasome-dependent degradation. Suppression of RAUL by dominant-negative RAUL or siRNA augmented both basal and virus-induced production of type I IFN, which resulted in reduced viral replication. The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus immediate-early lytic cycle trigger protein RTA recruited this mechanism to augment its countermeasures against the host antiviral response.

  abstract = {We have developed a model system in Caenorhabditis elegans to perform genetic and molecular analysis of peptidergic neurotransmission using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged IDA-1. IDA-1 represents the nematode ortholog of the transmembrane proteins ICA512 and phogrin that are localized to dense core secretory vesicles (DCVs) of mammalian neuroendocrine tissues. IDA-1::GFP was expressed in a small subset of neurons and present in both axonal and dendritic extensions, where it was localized to small mobile vesicular elements that at the ultrastructural level corresponded to 50 nm electron-dense objects in the neuronal processes. The post-translational processing of IDA-1::GFP in transgenic worms was dependent on the neuropeptide proprotein convertase EGL-3, indicating that the protein was efficiently targeted to the peptidergic secretory pathway. Time-lapse epifluorescence microscopy of IDA-1::GFP revealed that DCVs moved in a saltatory and bidirectional manner. DCV velocity profiles exhibited multiple distinct peaks, suggesting the participation of multiple molecular motors with distinct properties. Differences between velocity profiles for axonal and dendritic processes furthermore suggested a polarized distribution of the molecular transport machinery. Study of a number of candidate mutants identified the kinesin UNC-104 (KIF1A) as the microtubule motor that is specifically responsible for anterograde axonal transport of DCVs at velocities of 1.6 microm/s-2.7 microm/s.},

We demonstrate that glycolysis provides ATP for the FAT of vesicles. Although inhibiting ATP production from mitochondria did not affect vesicles motility, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the glycolytic enzyme GAPDH reduced transport in cultured neurons and in Drosophila larvae. GAPDH localizes on vesicles via a huntingtin-dependent mechanism and is transported on fast-moving vesicles within axons. Purified motile vesicles showed GAPDH enzymatic activity and produced ATP. Finally, we show that vesicular GAPDH is necessary and sufficient to provide on-board energy for fast vesicular transport. Although detaching GAPDH from vesicles reduced transport, targeting GAPDH to vesicles was sufficient to promote FAT in GAPDH deficient neurons. This specifically localized glycolytic machinery may supply constant energy, independent of mitochondria, for the processive movement of vesicles over long distances in axons.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}KIF1A is an essential neuronal transport motor protein in the kinesin-3 family, known for its superprocessive motility. However, structural features underlying this function are unclear. Here, we determined that superprocessivity of KIF1A dimers originates from a unique structural domain, the lysine-rich insertion in loop-12 termed the `K-loop', which enhances electrostatic interactions between the motor and the microtubule. In 80 mM PIPES buffer, replacing the native KIF1A loop-12 with that of kinesin-1 resulted in a 6-fold decrease in run length, whereas adding additional positive charge to loop-12 enhanced the run length. Interestingly, swapping the KIF1A loop-12 into kinesin-1 did not enhance its run length, consistent with the two motor families using different mechanochemical tuning to achieve persistent transport. To investigate the mechanism by which the KIF1A K-loop enhances processivity, we used microtubule pelleting and single-molecule dwell time assays in ATP and ADP. First, the microtubule affinity was similar in ATP and in ADP, consistent with the motor spending the majority of its cycle in a weakly bound state. Second, the microtubule affinity and single-molecule dwell time in ADP were 6-fold lower in the loop-swap mutant than WT. Thus, the positive charge in loop-12 of KIF1A enhances the run length by stabilizing binding of the motor in its vulnerable one-head\textendash bound state. Finally, through a series of mutants with varying positive charge in the K-loop, we found that KIF1A processivity is linearly dependent on the charge of loop-12, further highlighting how loop-12 contributes to the function of this key motor protein.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Recently, it was shown that endocytosis is also important for hyphal growth. Here, we found that the Aspergillus nidulans kinesin-3 motor protein UncA transports vesicles and is required for fast hyphal extension. Most surprisingly, UncA-dependent vesicle movement occurred along a subpopulation of microtubules. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled UncArigor decorated a single microtubule, which remained intact during mitosis, whereas other cytoplasmic microtubules were depolymerized. Mitotic spindles were not labeled with GFP-UncArigor but reacted with a specific antibody against tyrosinated {$\alpha$}-tubulin. Hence, UncA binds preferentially to detyrosinated microtubules. In contrast, kinesin-1 (conventional kinesin) and kinesin-7 (KipA) did not show a preference for certain microtubules. This is the first example for different microtubule subpopulations in filamentous fungi and the first example for the preference of a kinesin-3 motor for detyrosinated microtubules.}

  abstract = {The presence of an adequate blood supply is a critical factor in recovery from traumatic injuries. We have examined whether the revascularization of the injured tissues is as crucial a precondition for wound healing in the spinal cord as in other organs. The development of the initial primary lesion (PL) after spinal crush injury in rats is followed by the formation of a unique tunnel-like dorsal column lesion (DCL) that extends rostrocaudally for many millimeters from the primary injury site. The DCL has been shown to result from Wallerian degeneration of the long spinal tracts in the dorsal column. In this study, we compared the processes of revascularization, wound healing, and nerve regeneration in the PL and the DCL by light microscopy after a crush injury of the cord. The spinal cord of 54 adult rats was crushed at T8 with jewelers forceps. The rats were allowed to survive from 3 h up to 8 weeks after spinal cord injury. The PL appeared immediately after injury and the DCL began to develop 6 h later. Infiltration of neutrophils, which is the first sign of the inflammatory response to injury, began several hours later in the DCL than in the PL. Secondary vascular injury then occurred which resulted in hemorrhage around the DCL and rapid enlargement of the lesion during the remainder of the first week. Subsequent changes in the PL and the DCL were entirely different. The PL underwent progressive enlargement and cavitation such that by 8 weeks, the lesion contained only very few cells, vessels, and axons scattered between huge fluid-filled cavities. The DCL, on the other hand, was maximal in size at 1 week and declined significantly in size and cavitation thereafter. By 8 weeks it was highly vascularized, contained abundant nerve fibers, and lacked any trace of cavitation. These findings amplify the current view that ischemia plays a critical role in spinal cord trauma by showing that revascularization precedes tissue repair and nerve regeneration in the dorsal columns. We conclude (a) that a well-vascularized lesion permits the ingrowth of glial and other cells which give rise to a supportive matrix for the nerve regeneration and (b) that procedures which induce revascularization or angiogenesis will ameliorate the cascade of progressive tissue necrosis.},

Disturbance of this homeostasis causes ER stress and activates the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). The Ufm1 conjugation system is a novel Ubiquitin-like (Ubl) system whose physiological target(s) and biological functions remain largely undefined. Genetic study has demonstrated that the Ufm1-activating enzyme Uba5 is indispensible for erythroid differentiation in mice, highlighting the importance of this novel system in animal development. In this report we present the evidence for involvement of RCAD/Ufl1, a putative Ufm1-specific E3 ligase, and its binding partner C53/LZAP protein in ufmylation of endogenous Ufm1 targets. Moreover, we found that the Ufm1 system was transcriptionally up-regulated by disturbance of the ER homeostasis and inhibition of vesicle trafficking. Using luciferase reporter and ChIP assays, we dissected the Ufm1 promoter and found that Ufm1 was a potential target of Xbp-1, one of crucial transcription factors in UPR. We further examined the effect of Xbp-1 deficiency on the expression of the Ufm1 components. Interestingly, the expression of Ufm1, Uba5, RCAD/Ufl1 and C53/LZAP in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) was significantly induced by inhibition of vesicle trafficking, but the induction was negated by Xbp-1 deficiency. Finally, we found that knockdown of the Ufm1 system in U2OS cells triggered UPR and amplification of the ER network. Taken together, our study provided critical insight into the regulatory mechanism of the Ufm1 system and established a direct link between this novel Ubl system and the ER network.},

The mechanism by which reciprocal target cells find each other during the formation of gap junctions, however, is poorly understood. Here we show that gap junctions are formed between BDU interneurons and PLM mechanoreceptors in C. elegans and the connectivity of BDU with PLM is influenced by Wnt signaling. We further identified two PAS-bHLH family transcription factors, AHA-1 and AHR-1, which function cell-autonomously within BDU and PLM to facilitate the target identification process. aha-1 and ahr-1 act genetically upstream of cam-1. CAM-1, a membrane-bound receptor tyrosine kinase, is present on both BDU and PLM cells and likely serves as a Wnt antagonist. By binding to a cis-regulatory element in the cam-1 promoter, AHA-1 enhances cam-1 transcription. Our study reveals a Wnt-dependent fine-tuning mechanism that is crucial for mutual target cell identification during the formation of gap junction connections.},

Ten percent of the observed particles reversed direction of movement during the period of observation, and 10\% exhibited periods of movement interspersed with pauses. During episodes of persistent movement, particles moved at an average velocity of 1.02 microm/sec, which is close to the in vitro velocity of microtubule gliding driven by purified monomeric kinesin at high motor density.

Oocytes treated with drugs that suppress microtubule dynamics exhibit spindles that are reoriented more vertically to the cortex than untreated controls. A dominant-negative klp10A mutant shows both reoriented and shorter oocyte spindles, implying that, unexpectedly, KLP10A may stabilize rather than destabilize microtubules, regulating spindle length and positioning the oocyte spindle.

    abstract = { TRIM9 and TRIM67 are neuronally enriched E3 ubiquitin ligases essential for appropriate morphogenesis of cortical and hippocampal neurons and fidelitous responses to the axon guidance cue netrin-1. Deletion of murine Trim9 or Trim67 results in neuroanatomical defects and striking behavioral deficits, particularly in spatial learning and memory. TRIM9 and TRIM67 interact with cytoskeletal and exocytic proteins, but the full interactome is not known. Here we performed the unbiased proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) approach to define TRIM9 and TRIM67 protein–protein proximity network in developing cortical neurons and identified putative neuronal TRIM interaction partners. Candidates included cytoskeletal regulators, cytosolic protein transporters, exocytosis and endocytosis regulators, and proteins necessary for synaptic regulation. A subset of high-priority candidates was validated, including Myo16, Coro1A, MAP1B, ExoC1, GRIP1, PRG-1, and KIF1A. For a subset of validated candidates, we utilized total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to demonstrate dynamic colocalization with TRIM proteins at the axonal periphery, including at the tips of filopodia. Further analysis demonstrated that the RNA interference–based knockdown of the unconventional myosin Myo16 in cortical neurons altered growth cone filopodia density and axonal branching patterns in a TRIM9- and netrin-1–dependent manner. Future analysis of other validated candidates will likely identify novel proteins and mechanisms by which TRIM9 and TRIM67 regulate neuronal form and function. }
